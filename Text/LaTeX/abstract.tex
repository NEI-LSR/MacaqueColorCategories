One popular theory to explain the existence of color categories is to enable efficient inter-person communication via language; reducing the essentially infinite range of perceivable colors down to a subset of categories allows us communicate that information quickly and efficiently to another person via spoken language.
Other theories exist.
We recently found that a non-linguistic animal (macaques) appear to naturally use color categories. 
This strikes a blow to the idea that color categories exist \emph{solely} for linguistic inter-personal communication.
