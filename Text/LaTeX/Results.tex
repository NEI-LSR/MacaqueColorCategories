\paragraph{Monkeys exhibit hallmarks of color category behavior}

The animals examined show a hallmark of color categorization behavior: memory biases towards a set of particular points in a perceptually uniform colorspace.
In \autoref{fig:BiasCurves} it can be seen that the biases deviate substantially and systematically from zero, with the attractor points being found where the bias line crosses the zero line from positive to negative (going counter-clockwise). These points are highlighted with colored lines, with the filled areas around these lines showing the confidence intervals on these crossing points. Repeller points found where the line crosses the zero line from negative to positive.

\paragraph{Shared color categories across monkeys.}

We see that all tested monkeys share two common attractor points, which we interpret as evidence of two shared color categories: a warm/orange-ish category (between 0$^\circ$ and 45$^\circ$), and a cool/blue-ish category (between 180$^\circ$ and 225$^\circ$).

\paragraph{Individual differences between monkeys.}

In one animal we see evidence of additional categories: strong evidence for a greenish category and weak evidence for a purple category (the ``strength" of a category can be gleaned from looking at the local gradient at the zero-crossing point)

\paragraph{Learning rates/DKL.}

Figure XX shows the learning rate for each color plotted in DKL color space for M1, superimposed with a Fourier analysis of the data. Figure YY shows the corresponding power spectrum of the learning rate data. We found a significant peak along the S-cone axis at 2 Hz, which suggests that performance improved for colors along the S-cone axis faster than those along the L-M axis. We also found a significant peak along the daylight axis at 4 Hz. Figure 2A-B shows the corresponding data for M2.

\paragraph{Longitudinal analysis - power analysis and progression over time.}

Segmenting our data into subgroups of 5000 datapoints allowed us to both look at whether the determined categories varied over time, and also allowed us to perform a rough power analysis. From the monkeys studied it was clear that during our data collection period the categories remained static (within our measurement uncertainty), and also that the categories we saw are reliable enough to be seen with substantially less data.
