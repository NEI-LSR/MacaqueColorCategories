# Meeting with Hannah and Tim Brady


## What are our goals?
Estimate biases, as a means to answer "do macaques use colour categories?" (And if so which ones)

## What have we done?
- explain task
- 4AFC delayed match to sample
- direct match always available
- other distractors randomly sampled
- explain analysis
- fit curves to incorrect trials

## Why not TCC (so far)?
- Didn't have independent data to compute similarity functions
- Do we add noise to all of possible space, and then compute the closest value? Or just noise to distractors on each trial? (Talk through logic)
    - Tim says: think about the questions as just: which of the stimuli were most likely to cause that representation. Then you can just do the max on the 4 presented.

## Notes
xuexin wei, alan stocker at Penn
300 dimensional space
Same logic as the TCC model but in geometrical space instead
https://www.nature.com/articles/nn.4105
Sharper tuning functions
Tim says: very hard to read, but essentially just a geometric version of TCC

Orientation people vs color people - orientation think of different tuning widths, whereas color people think ‘categories’

In the iterative selection task they find things that don’t look like categories: https://bradylab.ucsd.edu/pdfs/DeStefano2020.pdf 

Offered to convince Bevil that this probably isn’t categories.

Try fitting with an entirely unconstrained similarity matrix and see what happens.

Code is on osf, dependent on mixture model toolbox.
