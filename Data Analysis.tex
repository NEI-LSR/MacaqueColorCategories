To measure color categorization behavior, we analyzed the monkey's errors in the behavioral task. For each cue, we plotted the monkey's choices on incorrect trials by the angular error between the cue and the choice. These values were normalized by the number of times each choice was presented as a choice option for all completed trials of the given cue. 
We then fit a Gaussian curve to the error distribution for each cue. This fit was weighted by the number of times each choice color was an option for the given cue across all completed trials. Bias was given in degrees by the difference between the cue (at 0 degrees) and the peak of the Gaussian. Bias was plotted for each cue. Category centers correspond to where the bias curve crosses the zero line on a downward slope.
