Joshua Fuller-Deets adapted code from Shay Ohayon to create the experimental paradigm; Rosa Lafer-Sousa collected pilot data; Whitney Teagle and Shriya Awasthi assisted data collection. 
Funding was provided by the Intramural Research Program of the National Eye Institute. 
We are thankful to the animal care team lead by Denise Parker and Hayden Warnock and to the veterinary staff of the NEI for excellent animal care. 
We thank members of the Laboratory of Sensorimotor Research, attendees of the Colour Group of Great Britain’s January Vision Meeting (2022), the Vision Sciences Society (2022, 2023), the Society for Neuroscience (2023), and the Color Workshop sponsored by the University of Giessen (Summer 2023) for helpful feedback. 
We thank Thorsten Hansen for consultation on color conversions, Ramon Bartolo for mathematical assistance, and Karl Gegenfurtner for the initial prompt to think about testing for color categories in macaques.
