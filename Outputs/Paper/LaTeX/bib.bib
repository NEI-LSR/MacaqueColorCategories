  abstract = {The effect of the light sources for art galleries and museums on fade-prevention of fabrics containing natural dyes was investigated. 11 fabrics dyed with four kinds of main colorants and five kinds of mordants, which are often used in textile properties and the Blue Scale were used as test samples. The light sources were the fluorescent lamp type D65 daylight illuminant simulator, the conventional cool white fluorescent lamp for general illumination, and the fluorescent lamp for art galleries and museums, which is designed to reduce fading by cutting the ultraviolet radiation. Under controlled temperature (29{$\pm$}1\textdegree C) and relative humidity (59{$\pm$}2 \%), exposure was continued for 700 hours. Then the color difference ({$\Delta$}E) of each sample was calculated.Discoloration of the Blue Scale was recognized for the scale less than 3rd grade for all the lamps, but {$\Delta$}E did not exceed 2. Comparing the grade of the discoloration of the dyed fabrics with that of the Blue Scale, curcumin/iron (III) acetate, quercetin, heamatoxylin, and carminic acid were equivalent to the 2nd grade, and curcumin/hydrated lime, alumstone, and ash were equivalent to the 1st grade for each lamp. From the comparison of {$\Delta$}E of the dyed fabrics between the lamps, the average effect on fade-prevention for lamp for art galleries and museums was 28\% compared with lamp type D65, and 30\% compared with the white lamp. The maximum fade-prevention effect was 50\% for curcumin/iron (III) acetate.},

The importance of this Scale is recently increasing not only in textile field but also in other various fields. Capability and reproducibility of this Blue Scale have been already enough explored, however, its spectral characteristics and action spectrum have not yet enough investigated.In this research, the color fading behavior of Blue Scale by 9 kinds of fluorescent lamps ( 20W ) having different spectral distribution was quantitatively investigated. As the results, the relation between the fading and the wavelength was clearly recognized on the scales less than 3rd grade. The principal wavelength of radiation which cause the fading were 525nm and 610nm for 1st grade scale, 352nm, 525nm and 610nm for 2nd grade scale and 352nm for 3rd grade scale. In case of grading the samples by comparing with Blue Scale under 3rd grade, it should be noted that tendency of the grading is different according to the spectral composition irradiated by light sources.},

In this research, the effect of the optical radiation on the discoloration of dyed fabrics under equal level of illuminance (500 lx) on samples using the three kinds of fluorescent lamps (D65, W, NU) and the eight kinds of dyed fabrics was investigated. The following results were obtained.(1) The order of discoloration degree was D65{$>$}W{$>$}NU. On dyed fabric, differences in each mordant and each colorant especially were recognized.(2) The discoloration reduction effect of the NU lamp compared to the D65 lamp and W lamp was 33\% and 9\%, respectively.(3) The discoloration reduction effect of the NU lamp compared to the D65 was 18\% for equal irradiance and 33\% for illuminance. The equal irradiance condition was defined as changing the lamp in the museum and the equal illuminance condition corresponds to not only changing the lamp, but also keeping the illuminance equal.(4) From this experiment, we found that the discoloration of dyed fabrics showed a closer relationship to the exposure dose of illuminance (lx{$\cdot$}hr) than that of irradiance (W{$\cdot$}hr).},

  abstract = {In 2004, CIE issued a technical report (CIE 157: 2004) entitled "Control of Damage to Museum Objects by Optical Radiation," in which it recommended that materials classified as highly responsive to light (ex. blue wool standard 1 to 3) be exposed for a maximum of 15000 lx{$\cdot$}hr/yr. The aim of this report is to validate the new CIE recommendation for natural yellow dyes categorized below the blue scale grade 4. Twenty types of natural yellow dyes on silk were exposed to both white and non-UV fluorescent museum lamps. Color differences were measured at 15000 lx{$\cdot$}hr (500 lx at fabric surface x 300 hr) intervals for 10 times, for an accumulated exposure totaling 150000 lx{$\cdot$}hr. The results show that non-UV fluorescent museumlamp was 24\% more effective in reducing the fading rate compared with white fluorescent lamp. Complying with the new CIE recommended maximum exposure of 15000 lx{$\cdot$}hr/yr, the fading rate for most yellow dyes, will be below the noticeable fading degree ({$\Delta$}E1.6) thus, the CIE recommendation is valid. However, additional dyes should also be classified as "extremely highly responsive." The limiting exposure for Ukon (Turmeric, Cucuma longa L., colorant: curcumin) should be 3500 lx{$\cdot$}hr/yr, and Kihada (Amur cork tree, Phellodendron amurencse Rupr., colorant: berberine) and Onion skin (Allium cepa L., colorant: quercetin) should be 8000{$\sim$}12000 lx{$\cdot$}hr/yr. This study demonstrated a need for revised classification of "extremely highly responsive" materials under museum lighting conditions.},

  abstract = {To evaluate the performance of white LEDs as museum lighting, the authors have conducted research and reported on the effect of illuminance level and color temperature on textiles dyed with natural dyes. In this research, four additional white LEDs with various correlated color temperatures and different material constructions and three types of conventional fluorescent lamp were tested yellow textiles that were sensitive to light and ranked in the highly responsive category of the CIE Technical Report (CIE-157-2004) for blue and red dyes. The color degradation degree caused by white LEDs was almost larger than that caused by conventional NU fluorescent lamp. Among the white LEDs, the degradation degree was LED/D (7483K) {$>$} LED/UV+RGB (5265K) {$>$} LED/B+YAG (5098K) {$>$} LED/L (3633K). For the same illuminance level when the content of the 400-500 nm radiation became larger, the degradation degree became larger. When the correlated color temperature was the same, the degradation degree was larger with LED/UV+RGB than with LED/B+YAG. The acceleration degree of degradation differed depending on the LED construction (combination of LED chip and fluorescent material) . From these results, it can be determined that for introducing white LEDs to museum lighting, not only the annual maximum exposure but also the material construction (combination of LED chip and phosphor) should be considered.},

  abstract = {Significance             The best examples of color terms across languages are often held to reflect universal focal colors in the opponent pairs red vs. green and yellow vs. blue. An opposing view holds that best examples reflect categories that are determined by local linguistic convention. We argue for a synthesis of these two proposals. We show that best examples of color terms across languages can be predicted from color term extensions using a statistical model that indicates which samples are most representative of a distribution. This model accounts for universal tendencies in best example choices across languages, and also accounts for cross-language variation. Our findings suggest that general statistical principles may illuminate fundamental aspects of color naming across languages.           ,              Focal colors, or best examples of color terms, have traditionally been viewed as either the underlying source of cross-language color-naming universals or derived from category boundaries that vary widely across languages. Existing data partially support and partially challenge each of these views. Here, we advance a position that synthesizes aspects of these two traditionally opposed positions and accounts for existing data. We do so by linking this debate to more general principles. We show that best examples of named color categories across 112 languages are well-predicted from category extensions by a statistical model of how representative a sample is of a distribution, independently shown to account for patterns of human inference. This model accounts for both universal tendencies and variation in focal colors across languages. We conclude that categorization in the contested semantic domain of color may be governed by principles that apply more broadly in cognition and that these principles clarify the interplay of universal and language-specific forces in color naming.},

  abstract = {That a change takes place in the hue of the spectrum colours when white is added to them has been noticed, but I am not aware that any measurement of the extent of the change has been made. The need of a quantitative investigation has been forced upon me by the fact that in a research on the colour of fluorescence in various bodies the value of the dominant colours obtained by a photographic method did not correspond exactly with that obtained from visual observations. The photographic results also showed that mixed with the dominant colour of the fluorescence was more or less white light, and it occurred to me that this added white might account for the difference. The colour-measuring apparatus, which has been described in various papers and most recently in the paper ``On a Modified Apparatus for the Measurement of Colour,'' was employed in the investigation, a slight modification in the method of obtaining the two similar spectra being carried out. In the apparatus described in that paper a portion of the beam of light which had traversed the collimator, the prisms, and the lens which brought the spectrum to a focus was diverted by means of a partially silvered mirror placed in the path of the beam. In that used in the present instance only the lower half of the beam was deflected at right angles to the axis of the beam, and again deflected nearly parallel to its original direction. Both deflections were made by silvered mirrors. The two spectra were of approximately the same intensity. Two colour patches could now be formed side by side on a white surface when slits were inserted in each spectrum. The beam of whie light reflected from the first surface of the first prism could be thrown on either of the patches. In the investigations here given the white was thrown on the right-hand patch which was produced by the spectrum formed the diverted beam.},

However, the photoreceptor contributions to the early redilation phase of the PIPR ({$<$} 6 s post-stimulus) have not been reported. Here, we evaluated the photoreceptor contributions to the early phase PIPR (0.6 s to 5.0 s) by measuring the spectral sensitivity of the criterion PIPR amplitude in response to 1 s light pulses at five narrowband stimulus wavelengths (409, 464, 508, 531 and 592 nm). The retinal irradiance producing a criterion PIPR was normalised to the peak and fitted by either a single photopigment nomogram or the combined melanopsin and rhodopsin spectral nomograms with the +L+M cone photopic luminous efficiency (V{$\lambda$}) function. We show that the PIPR spectral sensitivity at times {$\geq$} 1.7 s after light offset is best described by the melanopsin nomogram. At times {$<$} 1.7 s, the peak PIPR sensitivity shifts to longer wavelengths (range: 482 to 498 nm) and is best described by the combined photoreceptor nomogram, with major contributions from melanopsin and rhodopsin. This first report of melanopsin and rhodopsin contributions to the early phase PIPR is in line with the electrophysiological findings of ipRGC and rod signalling after the cessation of light stimuli and provides a cut-off time for isolating photoreceptor specific function in healthy and diseased eyes.},

  abstract = {The colors of two surfaces might appear exactly alike under one illuminant while varying under others. This is due to the metamerism phenomenon in which physically distinct reflectance spectra result in identical cone photoreceptor excitations. The existence of such metameric pairs can potentially cause great ambiguities for our visual perception by challenging phenomena such as color constancy. We investigated frequency and magnitude of metamerism in a wide range of scenarios by studying a large set of surface reflectance spectra illuminated under numerous natural and artificial sources of light. Our results extend previous studies in the literature by demonstrating that metamers are indeed relatively infrequent. Potentially troublesome cases in which two surfaces with an identical color under one illuminant appear very differently under a second illuminant are exceedingly rare. We used the frequency of metameric pairs in combination with non-metric multidimensional scaling to establish a new representation of illuminants based on metamerism. This approach imposes a systematic structure onto the representation of illuminants and allows to better prognosticate the likelihood of metamers under new illuminants.},

  abstract = {Simple color-difference formulae and pictorial images have traditionally been used to estimate the visual impact of color errors introduced by image-reproduction processes. But the limited gamut of RGB cameras constrains such analyses, particularly of natural scenes. The purpose of this work was to estimate visual sensitivity to color errors introduced deliberately into pictures synthesized from hyperspectral images of natural scenes without gamut constraints and to compare discrimination thresholds expressed in CIELAB and S-CIELAB color spaces. From each original image, a set of approximate images with variable color errors were generated and displayed on a calibrated RGB color monitor. The threshold for perceptibility of the errors was determined in a paired-comparison experiment. In agreement with previous studies, it was found that discrimination between original and approximate images needed on average a CIELAB color difference {$\Delta$}Eab* of about 2.2. Although a large variation of performance across the nine images tested was found when errors were expressed in CIELAB units, little variation was obtained when they were expressed in S-CIELAB units.},

  abstract = {Neurobehavioral studies in humans have long concentrated on changes in local activity levels during repetitive executions of a task. Spontaneous neural coupling within extended networks has latterly been found to also influence performance. Here, we intend to uncover the underlying mechanisms, the relative importance, and the interaction between spontaneous coupling and task-induced activations. To do so, we recorded two groups of healthy participants (male and female) during rest and while they performed either a visual perception or a motor sequence task. We demonstrate that, for both tasks, stronger activations during the task as well as greater network coupling through spontaneous {$\alpha$} rhythms at rest predict performance. However, high performers present an absence of classical task-induced activations and, instead, stronger spontaneous network coupling. Activations were thus a compensation mechanism needed only in subjects with lower spontaneous network interactions. This challenges classical models of neural processing and calls for new strategies in attempts to train and enhance performance. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Our findings challenge the widely accepted notion that task-induced activations are of paramount importance for behavior. This will have an important impact on interpretations of human neurobehavioral research. They further link the widely used techniques of quantifying network communication in the brain with classical neuroscience methods and demonstrate possible ways of how network communication influences human behavior. Traditional training methods attempt to enhance neural activations through task repetitions. Our findings suggest a more efficient neural target for learning: enhancing spontaneous neural interactions. This will be of major interest for a large variety of scientific fields with very broad applications in schools, work, and others.},

  abstract = {Summary Melanopsin photoreception enhances retinal responses to variations in ambient light (irradiance) and drives non-image-forming visual reflexes such as circadian entrainment [1\textendash 6]. Melanopsin signals also reach brain regions responsible for form vision [7\textendash 9], but melanopsin's contribution, if any, to encoding visual images remains unclear. We addressed this deficit using principles of receptor silent substitution to present images in which visibility for melanopsin versus rods+cones was independently modulated, and we recorded evoked responses in the mouse dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (dLGN; thalamic relay for cortical vision). Approximately 20\% of dLGN units responded to patterns visible only to melanopsin, revealing that melanopsin signals alone can convey spatial information. Spatial receptive fields (RFs) mapped using~melanopsin-isolating stimuli had ON centers with diameters {$\sim$}13\textdegree. Melanopsin and rod+cone responses differed in the temporal domain, and responses to slow changes in radiance (\&lt;0.9~Hz) and stationary images were deficient when stimuli were rendered invisible for melanopsin. We employed these data to devise and test a mathematical model of melanopsin's involvement in form vision and applied it, along with further experimental recordings, to explore melanopsin signals under simulated active view of natural scenes. Our findings reveal that melanopsin enhances the thalamic representation of scenes containing local correlations in radiance, compensating for the high temporal frequency bias of cone vision and the negative correlation between magnitude and frequency for changes in direction of view. Together, these data reveal a distinct melanopsin contribution to encoding visual images, predicting that, under natural view, melanopsin augments the early visual system's ability to encode patterns over moderate spatial scales.},

  abstract = {SummaryBackground In bright light, mammals use a distinct photopigment (melanopsin) to measure irradiance for centrally mediated responses such as circadian entrainment. We aimed to determine whether the information generated by melanopsin is also used by the visual system as a signal for light adaptation. To this end, we compared retinal and thalamic responses to a range of artificial and natural visual stimuli presented using spectral compositions that either approximate the mouse's experience of natural daylight (``daylight'') or are selectively depleted of wavelengths to which melanopsin is most sensitive (``mel-low''). Results We found reproducible and reversible changes in the flash electroretinogram between daylight and mel-low. Simultaneous recording in the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (dLGN) revealed that these reflect changes in feature selectivity of visual circuits in both temporal and spatial dimensions. A substantial fraction of units preferred finer spatial patterns in the daylight condition, while the population of direction-sensitive units became tuned to faster motion. The dLGN contained a richer, more reliable encoding of natural scenes in the daylight condition. These effects were absent in mice lacking melanopsin. Conclusions The feature selectivity of many neurons in the mouse dLGN is adjusted according to a melanopsin-dependent measure of environmental brightness. These changes originate, at least in part, within the retina. Melanopsin performs a role analogous to a photographer's light meter, providing an independent measure of irradiance that determines optimal setting for visual circuits.},

  abstract = {Across scientific disciplines, there is a rapidly growing recognition of the need for more statistically robust, transparent approaches to data visualization. Complementary to this, many scientists have called for plotting tools that accurately and transparently convey key aspects of statistical effects and raw data with minimal distortion. Previously common approaches, such as plotting conditional mean or median barplots together with error-bars have been criticized for distorting effect size, hiding underlying patterns in the raw data, and obscuring the assumptions upon which the most commonly used statistical tests are based. Here we describe a data visualization approach which overcomes these issues, providing maximal statistical information while preserving the desired `inference at a glance' nature of barplots and other similar visualization devices. These ``raincloud plots'' can visualize raw data, probability density, and key summary statistics such as median, mean, and relevant confidence intervals in an appealing and flexible format with minimal redundancy. In this tutorial paper, we provide basic demonstrations of the strength of raincloud plots and similar approaches, outline potential modifications for their optimal use, and provide open-source code for their streamlined implementation in R, Python and Matlab (               https://github.com/RainCloudPlots/RainCloudPlots               ).

  abstract = {Because the ability to hide in plain sight provides a major selective advantage to both prey and predator species, the emergence of the striking colouration of some animal species (such as many coral reef fish) represents an evolutionary conundrum that remains unsolved to date. Here I propose a framework by which conspicuous colours can emerge when the selective pressures for camouflage are relaxed (1) because camouflage is not essential under specific prey/predator conditions or (2) due to the impossibility of reducing the signal-to-background noise in the environment. The first case is found among non-predator-species that possess effective defences against predators (hence a ``Carefree World''), such as the strong macaws' beaks and the flight abilities of hummingbirds. The second case is found in diurnal mobile fish of coral reef communities, which swim in clear waters against highly contrasting and unpredictable background (hence an "Hyper-Visible World''). In those contexts the selective pressures that usually come secondary to camouflage (such as sexual, warning, species recognition or territorial display) are free to drive the evolution of brilliant and diverse colouration. This theoretical framework can also be useful for studying the conditions that allow for conspicuousness in other sensory contexts (acoustic, chemical, electrical, etc.).},

As can be seen from the list of contributors, the problems of vision engage the interest and experimental ingenuity of investi\- gators from a variety of disciplines. Thus we find authors affiliated with depart\- ments of biology, medical and physiological physics, ophthalmology, physics, physiology and anatomy, psychology, laboratories of neurophysiology, medical clinics, schools of optometry, visual and othcr types of research institutes. A continuing interplay between psychophysical studies and physiological work is everywhere evident. As more information about the physiological basis of vision accumulates, and new studies and analyses of receptor photochemistry and the neurophysiology of retina and brain appear, psychophysical studies of the intact organism become more sharply focused, sometimes more complex, and often more specialized. Technological advances have increased the variety and precision of the stimulus controls, and advances in measurement techniques have reopened old problems and stimulated the investigation of new ones. In some cases, new concepts are being drawn in to help further our under\- standing of the laws by which the visual mechanism operates; in other cases, ideas enunciated long ago have been reevaluated, developed more fully, and reified in terms of converging evidence from both psychophysical experiments and unit recordings from visual cells.},

To address this question, a colour-naming experiment was performed with colour-monitor images of natural scenes simulated under two different daylights of correlated colour temperature 6500 K and 25000 K. Images were obtained from a set of hyperspectral data to enable the accurate control of illuminant and reflectance spectra. Each scene contained a spherical test surface whose digitally manipulated spectral reflectance coincided with that of a sample drawn randomly from approximately 430 Munsell reflectances grouped into eight colour categories, namely, red, green, blue, yellow, pink, purple, brown, and orange. Observers had to name the colour of the test surface in each image, presented for 1 s, by pressing one of nine computer keys corresponding to the eight categorical colour names and a neutral category. Focal colours were estimated from the peaks of the smoothed distributions of observers' naming responses in the CIE 1976 (u{${'}$}, v{${'}$}) chromaticity diagram. The effect of the illuminant change was quantified by a focal colour constancy index, with values 0 and 1 corresponding to no constancy and perfect constancy. Average levels of focal colour constancy were close to those from traditional measures of colour constancy, but with variation across categories and surface lightness. For blue and purple surfaces levels approached 0.9. For many surface colours, colour naming seems to be robust under illuminant changes and may help to anchor non-categorical judgements of arbitrary surface colours in natural scenes.},

Existing iPPG methods analyse the light-tissue interaction of either active or passive (ambient) illumination. Many active iPPG methods assume the incident ambient light is negligible to the active illumination, resulting in high power requirements, while many passive iPPG methods assume near-constant ambient conditions. These assumptions can only be achieved in environments with controlled illumination and thus constrain the use of such devices. To increase the number of possible applications of iPPG devices, we propose a dual-mode active iPPG system that is robust to changes in ambient illumination variations. Our system uses a temporally-coded illumination sequence that is synchronized with the camera to measure both active and ambient illumination interaction for determining heart rate. By subtracting the ambient contribution, the remaining illumination data can be attributed to the controlled illuminant. Our device comprises a camera and an LED illuminant controlled by a microcontroller. The microcontroller drives the temporal code via synchronizing the frame captures and illumination time at the hardware level. By simulating changes in ambient light conditions, experimental results show our device is able to assess heart rate accurately in challenging lighting conditions. By varying the temporal code, we demonstrate the trade-off between camera frame rate and ambient light compensation for optimal blood pulse detection.},

Two measures of information are used, the energy and relative entropy. The energy is assessed by the eigendecomposition method. It is found that while 9 eigenvectors are necessary for full presentation of the spectral reflectances of surface colors, 5\textendash 8 eigenvectors are adequate to fully characterize the total variances of radiance spectrum, depending on light sources. Results also show that, the derived eigenvectors are sparse in some wavelengths mostly for the sources with limited numbers of emission bands. It is found that a significant spectral information loss occurs due to the illumination of surface colors. The Kullback- Leibler divergence measure is used to compare the relative entropy between reflectance spectra of objects and the corresponding radiance spectra of samples under each light source. Results show that there are big differences between the light sources in relative entropy between the reflectance spectra and the radiance spectra of objects. Based on energy and relative entropy considerations, the tri-band mixed-color white light LEDs generally have the highest loss of spectral information before the projection of radiance data over the reciver.},

Molecular genetic analysis of more than 3000 macaque monkeys showed the existence of dichromatic genotype. The defect gene is located in the X chromosome. Males carrying this defect gene on their X chromosome would have protanope characteristic. Females carrying this defect gene on one of their X chromosomes would be heterozygous. Electroretinogram (ERG) measurement shows that the sensitivity to red light was extremely low in protanopic male monkeys compared to the normal genotype. Heterozygous carrier female has sensitivity that is intermediate between the genetic protanopes and normal monkeys. Operant conditioning technique was used to see the color perception of crab eating monkey. Two dichromatic and two normal male monkeys were trained to do a color discrimination task with food as a reward. The task is finding a circle containing red color.

  abstract = {Neural activity during repeated presentations of a sensory stimulus exhibits considerable trial-by-trial variability. Previous studies have reported that trial-by-trial neural variability is reduced (quenched) by the presentation of a stimulus. However, the functional significance and behavioral relevance of variability quenching and the potential physiological mechanisms that may drive it have been studied only rarely. Here, we recorded neural activity with EEG as subjects performed a two-interval forced-choice contrast discrimination task. Trial-by-trial neural variability was quenched by {$\sim$}40\% after the presentation of the stimulus relative to the variability apparent before stimulus presentation, yet there were large differences in the magnitude of variability quenching across subjects. Individual magnitudes of quenching predicted individual discrimination capabilities such that subjects who exhibited larger quenching had smaller contrast discrimination thresholds and steeper psychometric function slopes. Furthermore, the magnitude of variability quenching was strongly correlated with a reduction in broadband EEG power after stimulus presentation. Our results suggest that neural variability quenching is achieved by reducing the amplitude of broadband neural oscillations after sensory input, which yields relatively more reproducible cortical activity across trials and enables superior perceptual abilities in individuals who quench more. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Variability quenching is a phenomenon in which neural variability across trials is reduced by the presentation of a stimulus. Although this phenomenon has been reported across a variety of animal and human studies, its functional significance and behavioral relevance have been examined only rarely. Here, we report novel empirical evidence from humans revealing that variability quenching differs dramatically across individual subjects and explains to a certain degree why some individuals exhibit better perceptual abilities than others. In addition, we found a strong relationship between variability quenching and suppression of broadband neural oscillations. Together, our results reveal the importance of reproducible cortical activity for enabling better perceptual abilities and suggest a potential underlying mechanism that may explain why variability quenching occurs.},

  abstract = {John Lythgoe was one of the pioneers of the 'Ecology of Vision', a subject that he ably delineated in his classic and inspirational book published some 20 years ago [1]. At heart, the original book aimed generally to identify inter-relationships between vision, animal behaviour and the environment. John Lythgoe excelled at identifying the interesting 'questions' in the ecology of an animal that fitted the 'answers' presented by an analysis of the visual system. Over the last twenty years, however, since Lythgoe's landmark publication, much progress has been made and the field has broadened considerably. In particular, our understanding of the 'adaptive mechanisms' underlying the ecology of vision has reached considerable depths, extending to the molecular dimension, partly as a result of development and application of new techniques. This complements the advances made in parallel in clinically oriented vision research [2]. The current book endeavours to review the progress made in the ecology of vision field by bringing together many of the major researchers presently active in the expanded subject area. The contents deal with theoretical and physical considerations of light and photoreception, present examples of visual system structure and function, and delve into aspects of visual behaviour and communi cation. Throughout the book, we have tried to emphasise one of the major themes to emerge within the ecology of vision: the high degree of adaptability that visual mechanisms are capable of undergoing in response to diverse, and dynamic, environments and behaviours.},

  abstract = {During last decades, the way of life in modern societies has deeply modified the temporal adjustment of the circadian system, mainly due to the inappropriate use of artificial lighting and the high prevalence of social jet-lag. Therefore, it becomes necessary to design non-invasive and practical tools to monitor circadian marker rhythms but also its main synchronizer, the light-dark cycle under free-living conditions. The aim of this work was to improve the ambulatory circadian monitoring device (ACM, Kronowise\textregistered ) capabilities by developing an algorithm that allows to determine light intensity, timing and circadian light stimulation by differentiating between full visible, infrared and circadian light, as well as to discriminate between different light sources (natural and artificial with low and high infrared composition) in subjects under free living conditions. The ACM device is provided with three light sensors: i) a wide-spectrum sensor (380-1100 nm); ii) an infrared sensor (700-1100 nm) and iii) a sensor equipped with a blue filter that mimics the sensitivity curve of the melanopsin photopigment and the melatonin light suppression curve. To calibrate the ACM device, different commercial light sources and sunlight were measured at four different standardized distances with both a spectroradiometer (SPR) and the ACM device. CIE S 026/E:2018 toolbox software was used to calculate the melanopic stimulation from data recorded by SPR. Although correlation between raw data of luminance measured by ACM and SPR was strong for both full spectrum (r = 0.946, p {$<$} 0.0001) and circadian channel (r = 0.902, p {$<$} 0.0001), even stronger correlations were obtained when light sources were clustered in three groups: natural, infrared-rich artificial light and infrared-poor artificial light, and their corresponding linear correlations with SPR were considered (r = 0.997, p{$<$}0.0001 and r = 0.998, p {$<$} 0.0001, respectively). Our results show that the ACM device provided with three light sensors and the algorithm developed here allow an accurate detection of light type, intensity and timing for full visible and circadian light, with simultaneous monitoring of several circadian marker rhythms that will open the possibility to explore light synchronization in population groups while they maintain their normal lifestyle.},

Part 3 on sensitivity and adaptation examines new research that bears directly upon the classical problems of visual psychophysics. Here, there is an initial concern with measurement, visual sensitivity, scaling, and adaptation. Part 4 discusses research on color vision while Part 5 on acuity, contrast, and movement considers some of the factors that contribute to these perceptions.

  abstract = {There exist two widely used notions concerning the structure of phenomenal color space. The first is the notion of unique/binary hue structure, which maintains that there are four unique hues from which all other hues are composed. The second notion is the similarity structure of hues, which describes the interrelations between the hues and hence does not divide hues into two types as the first notion does. Philosophers have considered the existence of the unique/binary hue structure to be empirically and phenomenally well-grounded, and the structure has been considered to be primary because this can account for the similarity structure. Consequently, the unique/binary hue structure has played a central role in color philosophy. This calls for the assessment of the justification for its existence carried out in this paper. It is concluded that, despite the prevalent view among philosophers, none of their reasons for endorsing the existence of the unique/binary hue structure are justified. Since the notion of the unique/binary hue structure appears intuitively plausible for many, however, a sketch explaining this intuition is outlined at the end.},

  abstract = {Colors are typically described by three values such as RGB, XYZ, and HSV. This is rooted to the fact that humans possess three types of photoreceptors under photopic conditions, and human color vision can be characterized by a set of three color matching functions (CMFs). CMFs integrate spectra to produce three colorimetric values that are related to visual responses. In reality, large variations in CMFs exist among color-normal populations. Thus, a pair of two spectrally different stimuli might be a match for one person but a mismatch for another person, also known as observer metamerism. Observer metamerism is a serious issue in color-critical applications such as soft proofing in graphic arts and color grading in digital cinema, where colors are compared on different displays. Due to observer metamerism, calibrated displays might not appear correctly, and one person might disagree with color adjustments made by another person. The recent advent of wide color gamut display technologies (e.g., LEDs, OLEDs, lasers, and Quantum Dots) has made observer metamerism even more serious due to their spectrally narrow primaries. The variations among normal color vision and observer metamerism have been overlooked for many years. The current typical color imaging workflow uses a single standard observer assuming all the color-normal people possess the same CMFs. This dissertation provides a possible solution for observer metamerism in color-critical applications by personalized color imaging introducing individual colorimetric observers. In this dissertation, at first, color matching data were collected to derive and validate CMFs for individual colorimetric observers. The data from 151 color-normal observers were obtained at four different locations. Second, two types of individual colorimetric observer functions were derived and validated. One is an individual colorimetric observer model, an extension of the CIE 2006 physiological observer incorporating eight physiological parameters to model individuals in addition to age and field size inputs. The other is a set of categorical observer functions providing a more convenient approach towards the personalized color imaging. Third, two workflows were proposed to characterize human color vision: one using a nomaloscope and the other using proposed spectral pseudoisochromatic images. Finally, the personalized color imaging was evaluated in a color image matching study on an LCD monitor and a laser projector and in a perceived color difference study on a SHARP Quattron display. The personalized color imaging was implemented using a newly introduced ICC profile, iccMAX.},

  abstract = {This paper presents detailed study of various color constancy techniques. Color constancy is the ability to estimate the color of the light source. Different illuminates may impact the appearance of an image as compared to the image taken under canonical light source. Human vision has the natural tendency to estimate the color of light source but this mechanism is not fully understood. So, this work presents various computational methods to estimate the effect of color of different light sources onto a digital image. This work has presented a comparative study of available research.},

The use of the tristimulus values from each measured spectrum, calculated with the Illuminant D65 and the Standard Observer CIE64 to obtain the principal components necessary to reconstruct the spectrum, allows a very high degree of metamerism to be attained between the two spectra (measured and reconstructed). Furthermore, this method of calculating the principal components allows reconstruction of the spectra of specimens from other sample sets that differ from the model group used in the PCA. The colorimetric accuracy obtained in the new sample sets is similar to that obtained for the model group.},

  abstract = {The act and experience of programming is, at its heart, a fundamentally human activity that results in the production of artifacts. When considering programming, therefore, it would be a glaring omission to not involve people who specialize in studying artifacts and the human activity that yields them: archaeologists. Here we consider this with respect to computer games, the focus of archaeology's nascent subarea of archaeogaming. One type of archaeogaming research is digital excavation, a technical examination of the code and techniques used in old games' implementation. We apply that in a case study of Entombed, an Atari 2600 game released in 1982 by US Games. The player in this game is, appropriately, an archaeologist who must make their way through a zombie-infested maze. Maze generation is a fruitful area for comparative retrogame archaeology, because a number of early games on different platforms featured mazes, and their variety of approaches can be compared. The maze in Entombed is particularly interesting: it is shaped in part by the extensive real-time constraints of the Atari 2600 platform, and also had to be generated efficiently and use next to no memory. We reverse engineered key areas of the game's code to uncover its unusual maze-generation algorithm, which we have also built a reconstruction of, and analyzed the mysterious table that drives it. In addition, we discovered what appears to be a 35-year-old bug in the code, as well as direct evidence of code-reuse practices amongst game developers. What further makes this game's development interesting is that, in an era where video games were typically solo projects, a total of five people were involved in various ways with Entombed. We piece together some of the backstory of the game's development and intoxicant-fueled design using interviews to complement our technical work. Finally, we contextualize this example in archaeology and lay the groundwork for a broader interdisciplinary discussion about programming, one that includes both computer scientists and archaeologists.},

  abstract = {Lighting constitutes more than 20\% of total U.S. electricity consumption, a similar fraction in the European Union, and an even higher fraction in many developing countries. Because many current lighting technologies are highly inefficient, improved technologies for lighting hold great potential for energy savings and for reducing associated greenhouse gas emissions. Solid-state lighting shows great promise as a source of efficient, affordable, color-balanced white light. Indeed, assuming market discount rates, engineering-economic analysis demonstrates that white solidstate lighting already has a lower levelized annual cost (LAC) than incandescent bulbs. The LAC for white solid-state lighting will be lower than that of the most efficient fluorescent bulbs by the end of this decade. However, a large literature indicates that households do not make their decisions in terms of simple expected economic value. After a review of the technology, we compare the electricity consumption, carbon emissions, and cost-effectiveness of current lighting technologies, accounting for expected performance evolution through 2015. We then simulate the lighting electricity consumption and implicit greenhouse gases emissions for the U.S. residential and commercial sectors through 2015 under different policy scenarios: voluntary solid-state lighting adoption, implementation of lighting standards in new construction, and rebate programs or equivalent subsidies. Finally, we provide a measure of cost-effectiveness for solidstate lighting in the context of other climate change abatement policies.},

However, all of the previous studies, the authors of this article are aware of, lack in realistic viewing and adaptation conditions. In the attempt of overcoming these deficiencies, a new experiment investigating the impact of long-term memory on the color appearance ratings of 12 familiar test objects was performed. The pooled observer data were modeled in CIECAM02 color space using bivariate Gaussian functions whose centroids define the corresponding memory color centers for each test object. Comparisons with previous results obtained by Smet et al. revealed no significant differences in the reported memory color centers, but showed distinct deviations in the covariance matrices defining the shape of the fitted distribution functions. It is supposed that this new set of functions will lead to significantly different results when being used for the construction of an updated memory-based color quality metric.},

  abstract = {Vertebrate color vision is evolutionarily ancient. Jawless fish evolved four main spectral types of cone photoreceptor, almost certainly complemented by retinal circuits to process chromatic opponent signals. Subsequent evolution of photoreceptors and visual pigments are now documented for many vertebrate lineages and species, giving insight into evolutionary variation and ecological adaptation of color vision. We look at organization of the photoreceptor mosaic and the functions different types of cone in teleost fish, primates, and birds and reptiles. By comparison less is known about the underlying neural processing. Here we outline the diversity of vertebrate color vision and summarize our understanding of how spectral information picked up by animal photoreceptor arrays is adapted to natural signals. We then turn to the question of how spectral information is processed in the retina. Here, the quite well known and comparatively \&lsquo;simple\&rsquo; system of mammals such as mice and primates reveals some evolutionarily conserved features such as the mammalian BlueON system which compares short and long wavelength receptors signals. We then survey our current understanding of the more complex circuits of fish, amphibians, birds and reptiles. Together, these clades make up more than 90\% of vertebrate species, yet we know disturbingly little about their neural circuits for colour vision beyond the photoreceptors. Here, long-standing work on goldfish, freshwater turtles and other species is being complemented by new insights gained from the experimentally amendable retina of zebrafish. From this body of work, one thing is clear: The retinal basis of colour vision in non-mammalian vertebrates is substantially richer compared to mammals: Diverse and complex spectral tunings are established at the level of the cone output via horizontal cell feedforward circuits. From here, zebrafish use cone-selective wiring in bipolar cells to set-up color opponent synaptic layers in the inner retina, which in turn lead a large diversity of color-opponent channels for transmission to the brain. However, while we are starting to build an understanding of the richness of spectral properties in some of these species\&rsquo; retinal neurons, little is known about inner retinal connectivity and cell-type identify.\&nbsp; To gain an understanding of their actual circuits, and thus to build a more generalised understanding of the vertebrate retinal basis of color vision, it will be paramount to expand ongoing efforts in deciphering the retinal circuits of non-mammalian models.},

  abstract = {Deimatic displays are a type of anti-predator behaviour that startles the predator. They have received much recent theoretical attention, enabling the empirical study of this phenomenon within a predictive framework. It has long been known that bluetongue skinks (Tiliqua spp.), when approached by predators, open their mouth widely and expose a conspicuously coloured tongue. Here, we test whether such `full-tongue' displays are triggered by an imminent predatory attack in the Northern Bluetongue skink Tiliqua scincoides intermedia and examine whether this display behaviour is consistent with the predictions from deimatic display theory. First, we demonstrate that luminance at the rear of the tongue, which is only exposed during full-tongue displays, is almost twice as high for lizard and bird receivers compared to the tip of the tongue, and that tongue colouration is generally more conspicuous to a bird than a lizard visual system. Second, staged predatory encounters using model predators reveal that lizards primarily exhibit full-tongue displays in the final stages of a predatory attack. Lizards performed full-tongue displays congruent with the predictions associated with deimatic displays, i.e. rapid exposure of conspicuous elements from a previously inconspicuous state concurrently with aggressive defensive behaviour, most frequently during the final stages of a predatory encounter. Surprisingly, we also found that lizards vary the area of the tongue exposed during chemoexploratory tongue-flicks depending on whether a predator is present or absent.Significance statementBluetongue skinks have long been known to expose their large blue tongue in response to predatory threats. However, this behaviour has never been investigated empirically. Here, we use Northern Bluetongue skinks (Tiliqua scincoides intermedia) to test whether this behaviour is consistent with predictions associated with deimatic displays. We show that the rear of their tongue is UV-blue and more conspicuous to predators compared to the tip and that this `full-tongue display' is only triggered in the final stages of a predatory attack.},

  abstract = {A subset of mammalian retinal ganglion cells expresses an opsin photopigment (melanopsin, Opn4) and is intrinsically photosensitive. The human retina contains melanopsin, but the literature lacks a direct investigation of its spectral sensitivity or G-protein selectivity. Here, we address this deficit by studying physiological responses driven by human melanopsin under heterologous expression in HEK293 cells. Luminescent reporters for common second messenger systems revealed that light induces a high amplitude increase in intracellular calcium and a modest reduction in cAMP in cells expressing human melanopsin, implying that this pigment is able to drive responses via both Gq and Gi/o class G-proteins. Melanopsins from mouse and amphioxus had a similar profile of G-protein coupling in HEK293 cells, but chicken Opn4m and Opn4x pigments exhibited some Gs activity in addition to a strong Gq/11 response. An action spectrum for the calcium response in cells expressing human melanopsin had the predicted form for an opsin : vitamin A1 pigment and peaked at 479 nm. The G-protein selectivity and spectral sensitivity of human melanopsin is similar to that previously described for rodents, supporting the utility of such laboratory animals for developing methods of manipulating this system using light or pharmacological agents.},

  abstract = {If a scientific paper is computationally reproducible, the analyses it reports can be repeated independently by others. At the present time most papers are not reproducible. However, the tools to enable computational reproducibility are now widely available, using free and open source software. We conducted a pilot study in which we offered `reproducibility as a service' within a UK psychology department for a period of 6 months. Our rationale was that most researchers lack either the time or expertise to make their own work reproducible, but might be willing to allow this to be done by an independent team. Ten papers were converted into reproducible format using R markdown, such that all analyses were conducted by a single script that could download raw data from online platforms as required, generate figures, and produce a pdf of the final manuscript. For some studies this involved reproducing analyses originally conducted using commercial software. The project was an overall success, with strong support from the contributing authors who saw clear benefit from this work, including greater transparency and openness, and ease of use for the reader. Here we describe our framework for reproducibility, summarise the specific lessons learned during the project, and discuss the future of computational reproducibility. Our view is that computationally reproducible manuscripts embody many of the core principles of open science, and should become the default format for scientific communication.},

It is unclear how this percept of ``pan-field colour'' comes about. We use novel stimuli\textemdash ``colour chimeras''\textemdash to demonstrate a related visual phenomenon in which observers perceive rich colour throughout images with large achromatic regions. This percept appears to critically depend on natural scene statistics. By separately manipulating chromatic and structural content in such images, we demonstrate that both the spatial distribution of colour and the presence of recognizable scene structure contribute to the experience of pan-field colour in these stimuli. Our results suggest that this percept is unlikely to be due to a low-level colour spreading process. Instead, we suggest that mechanisms dependent on natural scenes' chromatic and luminance statistics provide the basis for the phenomenon.},

This increase has been due to several factors such as development in sensor technology as well as directed efforts on political and stakeholder levels to promote projects which address the need for providing new methods for care given increasing challenges with an aging population. An important aspect of study in such system is how the data is treated and processed. This paper provides a recent review of the latest methods and algorithms used to analyze data from wearable sensors used for physiological monitoring of vital signs in healthcare services. In particular, the paper outlines the more common data mining tasks that have been applied such as anomaly detection, prediction and decision making when considering in particular continuous time series measurements. Moreover, the paper further details the suitability of particular data mining and machine learning methods used to process the physiological data and provides an overview of the properties of the data sets used in experimental validation. Finally, based on this literature review, a number of key challenges have been outlined for data mining methods in health monitoring systems.},

There are statistics-based and learning-based computational color constancy methods and the latter ones are known to be more accurate. For a given image these methods extract some features and since for some methods calculating and processing these features can be computationally demanding, this renders such methods slow and very often impractical for hardware implementation. In this paper simple, yet very powerful features for color constancy based on the red chromaticity are presented. A new color constancy method is proposed and it is demonstrated how an existing one can be simplified. In both cases state-of-the-art results are achieved.

  abstract = {{$<$}h3{$>$}ABSTRACT{$<$}/h3{$>$} {$<$}p{$>$}An enduring neuroscientific debate concerns the extent to which neural representation is restricted to networks of patches specialized for particular domains of perceptual input (Kaniwsher et al., 1997; Livingstone et al., 2019), or distributed outside of these patches to broad areas of cortex as well (Haxby et al., 2001; Op de Beeck, 2008). A critical level for this debate is the localization of the neural representation of the identity of individual images, (Spiridon \&amp; Kanwisher, 2002) such as individual-level face or written word recognition. To address this debate, intracranial recordings from 489 electrodes throughout ventral temporal cortex across 17 human subjects were used to assess the spatiotemporal dynamics of individual word and face processing within and outside cortical patches strongly selective for these categories of visual information. Individual faces and words were first represented primarily only in strongly selective patches and then represented in both strongly and weakly selective areas approximately 170 milliseconds later. Strongly and weakly selective areas contributed non-redundant information to the representation of individual images. These results can reconcile previous results endorsing disparate poles of the domain specificity debate by highlighting the temporally segregated contributions of different functionally defined cortical areas to individual level representations. Taken together, this work supports a dynamic model of neural representation characterized by successive domain-specific and distributed processing stages.{$<$}/p{$><$}h3{$>$}SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT{$<$}/h3{$>$} {$<$}p{$>$}The visual processing system performs dynamic computations to differentiate visually similar forms, such as identifying individual words and faces. Previous models have localized these computations to 1) circumscribed, specialized portions of the brain, or 2) more distributed aspects of the brain. The current work combines machine learning analyses with human intracranial recordings to determine the neurodynamics of individual face and word processing in and outside of brain regions selective for these visual categories. The results suggest that individuation involves computations that occur first in primarily highly selective parts of the visual processing system, then later recruits highly and non-highly selective regions. These results mediate between extant models of neural specialization by suggesting a dynamic domain specificity model of visual processing.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {Color is special among basic visual features in that it can form a defining part of objects that are engrained in our memory. Whereas most neuroimaging research on human color vision has focused on responses related to external stimulation, the present study investigated how sensory-driven color vision is linked to subjective color perception induced by object imagery. We recorded fMRI activity in male and female volunteers during viewing of abstract color stimuli that were red, green, or yellow in half of the runs. In the other half we asked them to produce mental images of colored, meaningful objects (such as tomato, grapes, banana) corresponding to the same three color categories. Although physically presented color could be decoded from all retinotopically mapped visual areas, only hV4 allowed predicting colors of imagined objects when classifiers were trained on responses to physical colors. Importantly, only neural signal in hV4 was predictive of behavioral performance in the color judgment task on a trial-by-trial basis. The commonality between neural representations of sensory-driven and imagined object color and the behavioral link to neural representations in hV4 identifies area hV4 as a perceptual hub linking externally triggered color vision with color in self-generated object imagery. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Humans experience color not only when visually exploring the outside world, but also in the absence of visual input, for example when remembering, dreaming, and during imagery. It is not known where neural codes for sensory-driven and internally generated hue converge. In the current study we evoked matching subjective color percepts, one driven by physically presented color stimuli, the other by internally generated color imagery. This allowed us to identify area hV4 as the only site where neural codes of corresponding subjective color perception converged regardless of its origin. Color codes in hV4 also predicted behavioral performance in an imagery task, suggesting it forms a perceptual hub for color perception.},

  abstract = {A central problem in color vision is that the light reaching the eye from a given surface can vary dramatically depending on the illumination. Despite this, our color percept, the brain's estimate of surface reflectance, remains remarkably stable. This phenomenon is called color constancy. Here we investigated which human brain regions represent surface color in a way that is invariant with respect to illuminant changes. We used physically realistic rendering methods to display natural yet abstract 3D scenes that were displayed under three distinct illuminants. The scenes embedded, in different conditions, surfaces that differed in their surface color (i.e. in their reflectance property). We used multivariate fMRI pattern analysis to probe neural coding of surface reflectance and illuminant, respectively. While all visual regions encoded surface color when viewed under the same illuminant, we found that only in V1 and V4{$\alpha$} surface color representations were invariant to illumination changes. Along the visual hierarchy there was a gradient from V1 to V4{$\alpha$} to increasingly encode surface color rather than illumination. Finally, effects of a stimulus manipulation on individual behavioral color constancy indices correlated with neural encoding of the illuminant in hV4. This provides neural evidence for the Equivalent Illuminant Model. Our results provide a principled characterization of color constancy mechanisms across the visual hierarchy, and demonstrate complementary contributions in early and late processing stages.},

  abstract = {Academic publishing is evolving and our current system of correcting research post-publication is failing, both ideologically and practically. It does not encourage researchers to engage in necessary post-publication changes in a consistent way. Worse yet, post-publication `updates' can be misconstrued as punishments or admissions of misconduct.             We propose a different model that publishers of research can apply to the content they publish, ensuring that any post-publication amendments are seamless, transparent and propagated to all the countless places online where descriptions of research appear. At the center of our proposal is use of the neutral term ``amendment'' to describe all forms of post-publication change to an article.             We lay out a straightforward and consistent process that applies to each of three types of amendment that differ only in the extent to which the study is amended: minor, major, and complete. This proposed system supports the dynamic nature of the research process itself as researchers continue to refine or extend the work, and removes the emotive climate particularly associated with retractions and corrections to published work. It allows researchers to cite and share the most up-to-date and complete versions of articles with certainty, and gives decision makers access to the most up-to-date information. Crucially, however, we do not underestimate the importance of investigations of potential misconduct. This proposal allows two interrelated processes - amendment of articles and investigation of misconduct - to be uncoupled temporally, allowing a more rapid correction of the literature at a journal while institutional investigations take place, without either having to follow the others' timeline.},

Psychophysical and pupillometric tests of colour discrimination based on this method have been developed. Preliminary data obtained in subjects with normal colour vision and in a group of dichromats are presented. The spatiotemporal luminance masking parameters selected do not affect the subject's ability to discriminate a chromatic difference. The results show that when the detection of luminance contrast components in the test pattern is eliminated, the isochromatic region in each class of dichromat is defined simply by tangents to the normal discrimination ellipse in a direction corresponding to the colour confusion line. The Pupil Colour Response (PCR) has also been investigated in a group of dichromats using the same visual stimuli and the results show that for a constant, suprathreshold chromatic displacement, the PCR is absent when the chromatic modulation is restricted in direction to the principal colour confusion line of a particular class of dichromat, although the same stimulus elicits clear responses in the remaining groups and in normal trichromats.},

  abstract = {A sudden change in illuminant (e.g., the outcome of turning on a tungsten light in a room illuminated with dim, natural daylight) causes a ``global'' change in perceived colour which subjects often recognise as a change of illuminant. In spite of this distinct, global change in the perceptual appearance of the scene caused by significant changes in the wavelength composition of the light reflected from different objects under the new illuminant, the perceived colour of the objects remains largely unchanged and this cornerstone property of human vision is often described as instantaneous colour constancy (ICC). ICC mechanisms are often difficult to study. The generation of appropriate stimuli to isolate ICC mechanisms remains a difficult task since the extraction of colour signals is also confounded in the processing of spatial chromatic context that leads to ICC. The extraction of differences in chromaticity that describe spatial changes in the wavelength composition of the light on the retina is a necessary operation that must precede colour constancy computations. A change of illuminant or changes in the spectral reflectance of the elements that make up the scene under a constant illuminant cause spatial changes in chromatic context and are likely to drive colour constancy mechanisms, but not exclusively. The same stimulus changes also cause differences in local luminance contrast and overall light flux changes, stimulus attributes that can activate different areas of the visual cortex. In order to address this problem we carried out a series of dichoptic experiments designed to investigate how the colour signals from the two eyes are combined in dichoptically viewed Mondrians and the extent to which the processing of chromatic context in monocularly driven neurons contributes to ICC. The psychophysical findings show that normal levels of ICC can be achieved in dichoptic experiments, even when the subject remains unaware of any changes of illuminant. Functional MRI (fMRI) experiments using new stimuli that produce stimulation of colour constancy mechanisms only in one condition with little or no difference in the activity generated in colour processing mechanisms in both test and reference conditions were also carried out. The results show that the processing of ICC signals generates strong activation in V1 and the fusiform colour area (V4, V4A). Significant activation was also observed in areas V2 and V3.},

The subject investigated was earlier diagnosed with type 2 diabetes, but recovered through diet and exercise, to the point of being free of diabetes. Before supplementation, the tests revealed borderline performance for photopic and mesopic visual acuity (VA), functional contrast sensitivity (FCS) and red / green (RG) colour vision. The subject's thresholds for yellow-blue (YB) colour vision and rod sensitivity were, however, just above normal, age-matched limits. Post supplementation, the results revealed increased macular pigment levels in the central retina. In addition, the results also revealed significant improvements in several, other aspects of vision, particularly at lower light levels. VA and FCS improved, but this outcome depended on whether the stimuli were of positive or negative luminance contrast. Rod and cone mediated vision showed significant changes with large improvements in rod sensitivity. Thresholds for detection of RG and particularly YB colours were also significantly lower post-supplementation.},

Changes in the perceived color of a central test stimulus as a result of surround illuminant changes are investigated in a number of successful binocular and dichoptic experiments. The contribution made by distant patches to instantaneous color constancy (ICC) is found to be small, with the immediate surround (i.e., {$<$}1.5-deg separation) contributing most of the constancy effect. A modified DCM technique was developed to study ICC in patients with unilateral damage to the primary visual cortex. The results of this part of the study suggest that retinal mechanisms do not contribute to ICC. Experiments carried out in subjects with cerebral achromatopsia reveal the existence of hidden constancy, even when the subjects are unable to see the result of functioning ICC mechanisms. Dichoptic implementation of the DCM technique yields reduced but significant ICC index values with more equal contribution from distant surrounds. Our findings suggest that early stage processing of chromatic information in the primary visual cortex contributes significantly to ICC, with only small contributions from extrastriate areas of the cortex.},

The principal methods for assessing colour vision and the techniques employed to isolate the use of colour signals are reviewed. Data on the continuous distribution of colour thresholds within deutan and protan observers and the variability within normal trichromatic colour vision are presented and the principal factors that contribute to this variability examined. The need to quantify the severity of colour vision loss and to classify accurately the subject's colour vision is examined in relation to colour assessment requirements in occupational environments. A method of establishing pass/fail limits that are functionally safe without disadvantaging subjects with congenital colour deficiency is described. Also discussed are the uses of novel colour tests to reveal acquired loss of chromatic sensitivity as an indication of early-stage diseases of the eye as well as the value such tests may have in early detection and subsequent treatment.},

  abstract = {Statistical regularities of the environment are important for learning, memory, intelligence, inductive inference, and in fact, for any area of cognitive science where an information-processing brain promotes survival by exploiting them. This has been recognised by many of those interested in cognitive function, starting with Helmholtz, Mach, and Pearson, and continuing through Craik, Tolman, Attneave, and Brunswik. In the current era, many of us have begun to show how neural mechanisms exploit the regular statistical properties of natural images. Shepard proposed that the apparent trajectory of an object when seen successively at two positions results from internalising the rules of kinematic geometry, and although kinematic geometry is not statistical in nature, this is clearly a related idea. Here it is argued that Shepard's term, ``internalisation,'' is insufficient because it is also necessary to derive an advantage from the process. Having mechanisms selectively sensitive to the spatio-temporal patterns of excitation commonly experienced when viewing moving objects would facilitate the detection, interpolation, and extrapolation of such motions, and might explain the twisting motions that are experienced. Although Shepard's explanation in terms of Chasles' rule seems doubtful, his theory and experiments illustrate that local twisting motions are needed for the analysis of moving objects and provoke thoughts about how they might be detected.},

This is usually treated as a problem in the wavelength domain, analogous to treating spatial resolution in terms of spatial positions in the image. What is attempted here is a treatment of colour vision in terms of the system's responses to spectral energy distributions that are sinusoidal functions of wavelength. These are called comb-filtered spectra, and the treatment is analogous to that of spatial vision in terms of spatial sinusoids. This gives some insight into the reasons for trichromacy, the advantages of oil droplets, and the narrow separation of the red and green mechanisms. It is also shown that the absorption spectra of photosensitive pigments are superimposable if plotted as a function of the fourth root of wavelength.},

The algorithms chosen for close study include two gray world methods, a limiting case of a version of the Retinex method, a number of variants of Forsyth's (1990) gamut-mapping method, Cardei et al.'s (2000) neural net method, and Finlayson et al.'s color by correlation method (Finlayson et al. 1997, 2001; Hubel and Finlayson 2000) . We investigate the ability of these algorithms to make estimates of three different color constancy quantities: the chromaticity of the scene illuminant, the overall magnitude of that illuminant, and a corrected, illumination invariant, image. We consider algorithm performance as a function of the number of surfaces in scenes generated from reflectance spectra, the relative effect on the algorithms of added specularities, and the effect of subsequent clipping of the data.

As observed in the World Color Survey (WCS), indeed, any two groups of individuals develop quite different categorization patterns, but some universal properties can be identified by a statistical analysis over a large number of populations. Here, we reproduce the WCS in a numerical model in which different populations develop independently their own categorization systems by playing elementary language games. We find that a simple perceptual constraint shared by all humans, namely the human Just Noticeable Difference (JND), is sufficient to trigger the emergence of universal patterns that unconstrained cultural interaction fails to produce. We test the results of our experiment against real data by performing the same statistical analysis proposed to quantify the universal tendencies shown in the WCS [Kay P \& Regier T. (2003)               Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA               100: 9085-9089], and obtain an excellent quantitative agreement.

We show here that the region defined previously [Lueck et~al. (1989) Nature, 340, 386?389; Zeki et~al. (1991) J. Neurosci., 11, 641?649; McKeefry \& Zeki (1997) Brain, 120, 2229?2242] as the human colour centre consists of two subdivisions, a posterior one, which we call V4 and an anterior one, which we refer to as V4{$\alpha$}, the two together being part of the V4-complex. The posterior area is retinotopically organized while the anterior is not. We discuss our new findings in the context of previous studies of the cortical colour processing system in humans and monkeys. Our new insight into the organization of the colour centre in the human brain may also account for the variability in both severity and degree of recovery from lesions producing cerebral colour blindness (achromatopsia).},

Amazon's Mechanical Turk (AMT) service is a new method of recruiting participants and conducting certain types of experiments. This study compares whether participants recruited through AMT give different responses than participants recruited through an online forum or recruited directly on a university campus. Moreover, we compare whether a study conducted within AMT results in different responses compared to a study for which participants are recruited through AMT but which is conducted using an external online questionnaire service. The results of this study show that there is a statistical difference between results obtained from participants recruited through AMT compared to the results from the participant recruited on campus or through online forums. We do, however, argue that this difference is so small that it has no practical consequence. There was no significant difference between running the study within AMT compared to running it with an online questionnaire service. There was no significant difference between results obtained directly from within AMT compared to results obtained in the campus and online forum condition. This may suggest that AMT is a viable and economical option for recruiting participants and for conducting studies as setting up and running a study with AMT generally requires less effort and time compared to other frequently used methods. We discuss our findings as well as limitations of using AMT for empirical studies.},

  abstract = {Predicting behavior of visual neurons To what extent are predictive deep learning models of neural responses useful for generating experimental hypotheses? Bashivan et al. took an artificial neural network built to model the behavior of the target visual system and used it to construct images predicted to either broadly activate large populations of neurons or selectively activate one population while keeping the others unchanged. They then analyzed the effectiveness of these images in producing the desired effects in the macaque visual cortex. The manipulations showed very strong effects and achieved considerable and highly selective influence over the neuronal populations. Using novel and non-naturalistic images, the neural network was shown to reproduce the overall behavior of the animals' neural responses. Science, this issue p. eaav9436 Structured Abstract INTRODUCTIONThe pattern of light that strikes the eyes is processed and re-represented via patterns of neural activity in a ``deep'' series of six interconnected cortical brain areas called the ventral visual stream. Visual neuroscience research has revealed that these patterns of neural activity underlie our ability to recognize objects and their relationships in the world. Recent advances have enabled neuroscientists to build ever more precise models of this complex visual processing. Currently, the best such models are particular deep artificial neural network (ANN) models in which each brain area has a corresponding model layer and each brain neuron has a corresponding model neuron. Such models are quite good at predicting the responses of brain neurons, but their contribution to an understanding of primate visual processing remains controversial. RATIONALEThese ANN models have at least two potential limitations. First, because they aim to be high-fidelity computerized copies of the brain, the total set of computations performed by these models is difficult for humans to comprehend in detail. In that sense, each model seems like a ``black box,'' and it is unclear what form of understanding has been achieved. Second, the generalization ability of these models has been questioned because they have only been tested on visual stimuli that are similar to those used to ``teach'' the models. Our goal was to assess both of these potential limitations through nonhuman primate neurophysiology experiments in a mid-level visual brain area. We sought to answer two questions: (i) Despite these ANN models' opacity to simple ``understanding,'' is the knowledge embedded in them already useful for a potential application (i.e., neural activity control)? (ii) Do these models accurately predict brain responses to novel images? RESULTSWe conducted several closed-loop neurophysiology experiments: After matching model neurons to each of the recorded brain neural sites, we used the model to synthesize entirely novel ``controller'' images based on the model's implicit knowledge of how the ventral visual stream works. We then presented those images to each subject to test the model's ability to control the subject's neurons. In one test, we asked the model to try to control each brain neuron so strongly as to activate it beyond its typically observed maximal activation level. We found that the model-generated synthetic stimuli successfully drove 68\% of neural sites beyond their naturally observed activation levels (chance level is 1\%). In an even more stringent test, the model revealed that it is capable of selectively controlling an entire neural subpopulation, activating a particular neuron while simultaneously inactivating the other recorded neurons (76\% success rate; chance is 1\%).Next, we used these non-natural synthetic controller images to ask whether the model's ability to predict the brain responses would hold up for these highly novel images. We found that the model was indeed quite accurate, predicting 54\% of the image-evoked patterns of brain response (chance level is 0\%), but it is clearly not yet perfect. CONCLUSIONEven though the nonlinear computations of deep ANN models of visual processing are difficult to accurately summarize in a few words, they nonetheless provide a shareable way to embed collective knowledge of visual processing, and they can be refined by new knowledge. Our results demonstrate that the currently embedded knowledge already has potential application value (neural control) and that these models can partially generalize outside the world in which they ``grew up.'' Our results also show that these models are not yet perfect and that more accurate ANN models would produce even more precise neural control. Such noninvasive neural control is not only a potentially powerful tool in the hands of neuroscientists but also could lead to a new class of therapeutic applications. {$<$}img class="fragment-image" aria-describedby="F1-caption" src="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/sci/364/6439/eaav9436/F1.medium.gif"/{$>$} Download high-res image Open in new tab Download Powerpoint Collection of images synthesized by a deep neural network model to control the activity of neural populations in primate cortical area V4.We used a deep artificial neural network to control the activity pattern of a population of neurons in cortical area V4 of macaque monkeys by synthesizing visual stimuli that, when applied to the subject's retinae, successfully induced the experimenter-desired neural response patterns. Particular deep artificial neural networks (ANNs) are today's most accurate models of the primate brain's ventral visual stream. Using an ANN-driven image synthesis method, we found that luminous power patterns (i.e., images) can be applied to primate retinae to predictably push the spiking activity of targeted V4 neural sites beyond naturally occurring levels. This method, although not yet perfect, achieves unprecedented independent control of the activity state of entire populations of V4 neural sites, even those with overlapping receptive fields. These results show how the knowledge embedded in today's ANN models might be used to noninvasively set desired internal brain states at neuron-level resolution, and suggest that more accurate ANN models would produce even more accurate control. A deep artificial neural network can model primate vision. A deep artificial neural network can model primate vision.},

In the present study, the suitability of this ratio principle is tested for two chromatic postreceptoral opponent channels. A Hering red/green channel and a non-Hering yellow/blue channel are specified as chromatic channels. The yellow/blue channel is defined by extrapolating the plane corresponding to unique green-white linearly to the reddish part of color space, using the plane's surface as the channel's equilibria. The experiment was run on an isoluminant plane, measured individually for each observer. Moving along an observer's measured opponent axes, eight adaptation stimuli were selected for each channel and spanned the whole range of the channel's coordinates. Red/green equilibria or yellow/blue equilibria were measured as excursions along the adaptation axes. For both presumed channels, the ratios of the equilibrium coordinates of test and adaptation stimuli were essentially constant. This supports the principle's suitability. However, small asymmetries were found with respect to each channel's opponent hues. The status of the proposed yellow/blue channel is discussed, as are conditions that might have favored the present findings.},

The manuscript described a doubleblind, placebo control study purportedly demonstrating that intravenous propranolol reduced the pain of acute migraine headache. There were 10 major and 13 minor errors placed in the manuscript. The work was distributed to all reviewers of Annals of Emergency Medicine for review. Results: The manuscript was sent to 262 reviewers; 203 (78\%) reviews were returned. One-hundred ninety-nine reviewers recommended a disposition for the manuscript: 15 recommended acceptance, 117 rejection, and 67 revision. The 15 who recommended acceptance identified 17.3\% (95\% confidence interval [CI] 11.3\% to 23.4\%) of the major and 11.8\% (CI 7.3\% to 16.3\%) of the minor errors. The 117 who recommended rejection identified 39.1\% (CI 36.3\% to 41.9\%) of the major and 25.2\% (CI 23.0\% to 27.4\%) of the minor errors. The 67 who recommended revision identified 29.6\% (CI 26.1\% to 33.1\%) of the major and 22.0\% (CI 19.3\% to 24.8\%) of the minor errors. The number of errors identified differed significantly across recommended disposition. Sixty-eight percent of the reviewers did not realize that the conclusions of the work were not supported by the results. Conclusion: These data suggest that the use of a preconceived manuscript into which purposeful errors are placed may be a viable approach to evaluate reviewer performance.

The amplitude and shape of the response to a flash depended upon the number of photons absorbed but not the wave-length, so that the 'Principle of Univariance' was obeyed. 3. Spectra were obtained from five 'blue', twenty 'green', and sixteen 'red' cones. The wave-lengths of maximum sensitivity were approximately 430, 531 and 561 nm, respectively. 4. The spectra of the three types of cones had similar shapes when plotted on a log wave number scale, and were fitted by an empirical expression. 5. There was no evidence for the existence of subclasses of cones with different spectral sensitivities. Within a class, the positions of the individual spectra on the wave-length axis showed a standard deviation of less than 1.5 nm. 6. Psychophysical results on human colour matching (Stiles \& Burch, 1955; Stiles \& Burch, 1959) were well predicted from the spectral sensitivities of the monkey cones. After correction for pre-retinal absorption and pigment self-screening, the spectra of the red and green cones matched the respective pi 5 and pi 4 mechanisms of Stiles (1953, 1959).},

In visual memory, attempts to account for errors in terms of allocation of a limited pool of working memory resources have met with some success, but the biological basis for this cognitive architecture is unclear. An alternative perspective attributes recall errors to noise in tuned populations of neurons that encode stimulus features in spiking activity. I show that errors associated with decreasing signal strength in probabilistically spiking neurons reproduce the pattern of failures in human recall under increasing memory load. In particular, deviations from the normal distribution that are characteristic of working memory errors and have been attributed previously to guesses or variability in precision are shown to arise as a natural consequence of decoding populations of tuned neurons. Observers possess fine control over memory representations and prioritize accurate storage of behaviorally relevant information, at a cost to lower priority stimuli. I show that changing the input drive to neurons encoding a prioritized stimulus biases population activity in a manner that reproduces this empirical tradeoff in memory precision. In a task in which predictive cues indicate stimuli most probable for test, human observers use the cues in an optimal manner to maximize performance, within the constraints imposed by neural noise.},

In recent years, debates regarding the capacity and fidelity of the working memory (WM) system have driven significant advances in our understanding of the nature of these representations. In particular, there is growing recognition that WM representations are not merely imperfect copies of a perceived object or event, as new experimental tools have revealed that observers possess richer information about the uncertainty in their memories, and take advantage of environmental regularities to use limited memory resources optimally. Meanwhile, computational models of visual WM formulated at different levels of implementation have converged on common principles relating capacity to variability and uncertainty. Here we review recent research in human visual WM from a computational perspective and the latest developments in identifying neural mechanisms that support it.},

  abstract = {Most descriptions of the color rendering properties of light sources are based on the calculation of color differences for a number of reflectance samples between the light source and a reference source. The CIE color rendering index (CRI) is a single number based on the average color difference for eight reflectance samples. Since its introduction, the CRI has been discussed at length and many alternatives have been suggested to improve the description of color rendering. These metrics comprise among others, metrics based on color fidelity, color gamut, and color preference and combinations of these. All of these new proposals try to capture a certain color rendering aspect in a single number index to be used instead of or together with the existing CIE CRI. The ``traditional'' CRI has been criticized due to the fact that a single number index does not provide sufficient information about the color rendering properties of light sources. Creating a (second) single number metric seems to be a bit of a paradox, because it suffers from the same limitation by providing an average number to characterize certain color aspects for all colors. In our view, the best way to provide users of lighting in whatever application with accurate information on color characteristics is to provide specific information on the most important color characteristics such as hue, chroma, and lightness. In this article, we describe our methods of supplying hue-specific information via color rendering vectors and color rendering icons. We illustrate why we believe that it is important to add hue-specific information and what the shortcomings are of a second hue-averaged metric. We acknowledge that color appearance models have advanced since our first calculations and that it would be more appropriate to use CIECAM02. In addition, several recent papers have appeared discussing improved reflectance sample sets. These advancements, however, do not change the key message in this article, which advocates the use of graphics to communicate shifts in hue and chroma.},

Thus, we propose a novel framework for estimating the colors of multiple illuminants and their spatial distribution in the scene. We formulate this problem as an energy minimization task within a Conditional Random Field over a set of local illuminant estimates. In order to quantitatively evaluate the proposed method, we created a novel dataset of twodominant-illuminants images comprised of laboratory, indoor and outdoor scenes. Unlike prior work, our database includes accurate pixel-wise ground truth illuminant information. The performance of our method is evaluated on multiple datasets.

  abstract = {Melanopsin is a novel opsin synthesized in a small subset of retinal ganglion cells. Ganglion cells expressing melanopsin are capable of depolarizing in response to light in the absence of rod or cone input and are thus intrinsically light sensitive. Melanopsin ganglion cells convey information regarding general levels of environmental illumination to the suprachiasmatic nucleus, the intergeniculate leaflet, and the pretectum. Typically, retinal ganglion cells communicate information to central visual structures by receiving input from retinal photoreceptors via bipolar and amacrine cells. Because melanopsin ganglion cells do not require synaptic input to generate light-induced signals, these cells need not receive synapses from other neurons in the retina. In this study, we examined the ultrastructure of melanopsin ganglion cells in the mouse retina to determine the type (if any) of synaptic input these cells receive. Melanopsin immunoreaction product was associated primarily with the plasma membrane of (1) perikarya in the ganglion cell layer, (2) dendritic processes in the inner plexiform layer (IPL), and (3) axons in the optic fiber layer. Melanopsin-immunoreactive dendrites in the inner (ON) region of the IPL were postsynaptic to bipolar and amacrine terminals, whereas melanopsin dendrites stratifying in the outer (OFF) region of the IPL received only amacrine terminals. These observations suggested that rod and/or cone signals may be capable of modifying the intrinsic light response in melanopsin-expressing retinal ganglion cells. J. Comp.

  abstract = {Intrinsic image decomposition separates an image into a reflectance layer and a shading layer. Automatic intrinsic image decomposition remains a significant challenge, particularly for real-world scenes. Advances on this longstanding problem have been spurred by public datasets of ground truth data, such as the MIT Intrinsic Images dataset. However, the difficulty of acquiring ground truth data has meant that such datasets cover a small range of materials and objects. In contrast, real-world scenes contain a rich range of shapes and materials, lit by complex illumination. In this paper we introduce Intrinsic Images in the Wild, a large-scale, public dataset for evaluating intrinsic image decompositions of indoor scenes. We create this benchmark through millions of crowdsourced annotations of relative comparisons of material properties at pairs of points in each scene. Crowdsourcing enables a scalable approach to acquiring a large database, and uses the ability of humans to judge material comparisons, despite variations in illumination. Given our database, we develop a dense CRF-based intrinsic image algorithm for images in the wild that outperforms a range of state-of-the-art intrinsic image algorithms. Intrinsic image decomposition remains a challenging problem; we release our code and database publicly to support future research on this problem, available online at http://intrinsic.cs.cornell.edu/.},

However, the datasets we have for visualizing and modeling rich surface appearance in context, in applications such as home remodeling, are quite limited. To help address this need, we present OpenSurfaces, a rich, labeled database consisting of thousands of examples of surfaces segmented from consumer photographs of interiors, and annotated with material parameters (reflectance, material names), texture information (surface normals, rectified textures), and contextual information (scene category, and object names). Retrieving usable surface information from uncalibrated Internet photo collections is challenging. We use human annotations and present a new methodology for segmenting and annotating materials in Internet photo collections suitable for crowdsourcing (e.g., through Amazon's Mechanical Turk). Because of the noise and variability inherent in Internet photos and novice annotators, designing this annotation engine was a key challenge; we present a multi-stage set of annotation tasks with quality checks and validation. We demonstrate the use of this database in proof-of-concept applications including surface retexturing and material and image browsing, and discuss future uses.

Thirty-nine percent of this subset displayed color change in anoxia that was between two and four times lower than that observed in air, whereas 47\% showed color change in anoxia reduced by a factor of four or more. In contrast, six samples exhibited greater color change in anoxia than in air \textendash{} these samples included Prussian blue watercolor (three samples), Antwerp blue watercolor, Verdigris dry pigment, and Fluorescent Yellow Winsor \& Newton Gouache.

  abstract = {In computer vision, colour naming has been posed as a fuzzy-set problem where each colour category is modeled by a function that assigns a membership value to any given sample. However, the success in the automation of this process relies on having an appropriate psychophysical data set for this purpose. In this article we present a data set obtained from a colour-naming experiment. In this experiment, we used a scoring method to collect a set of judgments adequate for the fuzzy modeling of the colour-naming task. The data set is composed of 387 colour reflectances, their CIELab and Munsell values, and the corresponding judgments provided by the subjects in the experiment. These judgments are the membership values to the 11 basic colour categories proposed by Berlin and Kay (Berlin B, Kay P. Berkeley: University of California; 1969). All these data have been made available online (http://www.cvc.uab.es/color\_naming) and, in this article we provide a wide analysis of them. To prove the suitability of the proposed scoring methodology, we have computed a set of common statistics in colour-naming experiments, such as consensus and consistency, on our data set. The results make it possible for us to conclude the coherence of our data with previous experiments and, thus, its usefulness for the fuzzy modeling of colour naming. \textcopyright{} 2005 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

  abstract = {Facial expressions of emotion in humans are believed to be produced by contracting one's facial muscles, generally called action units. However, the surface of the face is also innervated with a large network of blood vessels. Blood flow variations in these vessels yield visible color changes on the face. Here, we study the hypothesis that these visible facial colors allow observers to successfully transmit and visually interpret emotion even in the absence of facial muscle activation. To study this hypothesis, we address the following two questions. Are observable facial colors consistent within and differential between emotion categories and positive vs. negative valence? And does the human visual system use these facial colors to decode emotion from faces? These questions suggest the existence of an important, unexplored mechanism of the production of facial expressions of emotion by a sender and their visual interpretation by an observer. The results of our studies provide evidence in favor of our hypothesis. We show that people successfully decode emotion using these color features, even in the absence of any facial muscle activation. We also demonstrate that this color signal is independent from that provided by facial muscle movements. These results support a revised model of the production and perception of facial expressions of emotion where facial color is an effective mechanism to visually transmit and decode emotion.},

A fundamental tenet of this approach is that the response properties of neurons in one context, e.g. color stimuli, are representative of responses in other contexts, e.g. natural scenes. This assumption is not often tested. Here, for neurons in macaque area V4, we first estimated tuning curves for hue by presenting artificial stimuli of varying hue, and then tested whether these would correlate with hue tuning curves estimated from responses to natural images. We found that neurons' hue tuning on artificial stimuli was not representative of their hue tuning on natural images, even if the neurons were strongly color-responsive. One explanation of this result is that neurons in V4 respond to interactions between hue and other visual features. This finding exemplifies how tuning curves estimated by varying a small number of stimulus features can communicate a small and potentially unrepresentative slice of the neural response function.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

Applications carried on two exchange rates (Euro\textendash Dollar and Dollar\textendash Yen), and two indexes (S\&P 500 and Nikkei 225) over four frequencies: weekly, daily, 30-min and 5-min, confirm the superiority of the SGT and GH in approximating the distribution of a given data at a remarkable precision. Moreover, as we move from higher to lower frequency, the distribution's overall shape does indeed change radically, and the estimated parameters refute the tendency to normality, which calls into question the aggregational Gaussianity's stylized fact.},

In order for the visual system to accurately represent the color of stimuli, it must (in effect) know the class of the cone that produced each response. The long- and medium-wavelength-sensitive cones, however, are virtually identical in every known way except that their responses to a given spectrum of light differ. Here, we simulate cones in a model human retina and show that by examining the correlation of the responses of cones to natural scenes, it is possible to determine both the number cone classes present in a retinal mosaic and to explicitly determine the class of each cone. These findings shed light on the computational mechanisms that may have enabled the evolution of human color vision, as well as on the more general question of whether and when it is possible for sensory systems to self-organize.},

An alternative theory in which memory resource is a continuous quantity distributed over all items seems to be refuted by the appearance of guessing in human responses. Here, we introduce a model in which resource is not only continuous but also variable across items and trials, causing random fluctuations in encoding precision. We tested this model against previous models using two VSTM paradigms and two feature dimensions. Our model accurately accounts for all aspects of the data, including apparent guessing, and outperforms slot models in formal model comparison. At the neural level, variability in precision might correspond to variability in neural population gain and doubly stochastic stimulus representation. Our results suggest that VSTM resource is continuous and variable rather than discrete and fixed and might explain why subjective experience of VSTM is not all or none.},

  abstract = {The relationship was derived for computer-controlled color CRT displays between spectral radiant exitance emitted and digital counts. The derivation was historical and could be traced to pioneering work in photographic sensitometry, vacuum tube physics, and broadcast television. By performing radiometric measurements relative to a display's maximum exitance, the model simplified to a two-stage model. The first stage was a nonlinear transformation relating normalized digital-to-analog converter values to device-dependent monitor tristimulus values using model parameters of gain, offset, and {$\gamma$}. The second stage was a linear transformation where the device-dependent monitor tristimulus values were transformed to device-independent CIE tristimulus values. By using the model, colorimetric characterization accuracy of better than 0.5 CIELAB color-difference units for 125 colors sampling the display color gamut was achieved by measuring the CIE tristimulus values of only eight colors. The model had equivalent performance to methods using extensive measurements and table lookup. \textcopyright{} 1993 John Wiley \& Sons, Inc.},

Precision and accuracy requirements for photometers, colorimeters, and spectroradiometers were evaluated. When models are used to relate digital counts defining a stimulus and resulting spectral radiant exitance, displays are assumed to exhibit channel and spatial independence. A variety of tests and the results of evaluating four imaging systems are described. From these analyses, measurement accuracy is mainly limited by wavelength scale in the case of spectro-radiometers and filter fit in the case of colorimeters. Measurement precision is limited by the number of significant figures for fixed-range devices and signal-to-noise limitations for low-luminance stimuli. Display accuracy is limited by a lack of channel and spatial independence. Display precision is mainly limited by the electronic design of the display and the stability and load independence of the gun amplifiers. \textcopyright{} 1993 John Wiley \& Sons, Inc.},

  abstract = {Human brightness perception is the result of at least three visual channels: The achromatic luminance channel, the red-green (R-G) color opponent channel and the blue-yellow (B-Y) color opponent channel. Short-wavelength output of light sources enhances brightness perception for stimuli subtending large visual angles in the low-to-moderate photopic range (\textasciitilde 2 lux - \textasciitilde 150 lux). This is partially explained by a contribution of short-wavelength (S) cones. Recent evidence from experiments conducted with mice as well as humans suggests that intrinsically-photosensitive retinal ganglion cells (ipRGCs) containing the photopigment melanopsin might also underlie increased short-wavelength spectral sensitivity of human brightness perception. The objective of the present thesis was to investigate whether melanopsin could be contributing directly to human scene brightness perception. Two experimental investigations of the relative potential contribution of S-cones (B-Y opponent color channel) and ipRGCs to scene brightness at 6 light levels between 2 lux and 150 lux were conducted. Subjects provided forced-choice brightness judgments and relative brightness magnitude judgments at two light level ranges, with two different stimuli presented sequentially in counterbalanced order. Experiment 1 used a "Green" stimulus composed of LED illumination peaking at 525 nm and 625 nm, and a "Fuchsia" stimulus composed of LEDs peaking at 465 nm and 625 nm. S-cone stimulation from the Green stimulus was only 10\% of that from the Fuchsia stimulus, melanopsin stimulation however was substantial (for both stimuli). The hypothesis was therefore that Green would be perceived as brighter than predicted by a provisional brightness model developed by Rea et al. (2011) that only takes into account cone responses, and not melanopsin. Experiment 2 used two "Amber" stimuli, one composed of an LED with peak output at 599 nm (Amber 1), and another composed of LEDs peaking at 520 nm and 635 nm (Amber 2). While both stimuli had negligible S-cone stimulation, Amber 2 did stimulate melanopsin 8 times more than Amber 1 for the same photopic light level. The hypothesis was therefore that if melanopsin were to contribute to brightness perception, Amber 2 would be perceived as brighter than Amber 1. Brightness judgments for the stimuli with higher potential for melanopsin stimulation were indeed higher in both experiments than would be predicted if S-cones were the only short-wavelength-sensitive mechanism contributing to brightness perception, thus supporting the possibility of melanopsin contribution. Post hoc analysis using data from Experiment 1 and 2, and utilizing previously published (in 2011 and 2013) provisional brightness models as a foundation, showed that the data could be fitted well by modifying the relative S-cone contribution in the equations and including a melanopsin coefficient that increased relative to an increase in light level. This refined model also predicted results from prior experiments. The improvements between this new model and the 2011 model were relatively large, while they were not as large in comparison with the previous 2013 model. The ability to quantify and predict scene brightness perception evoked by a particular light source opens up the possibility of optimizing lighting solutions for maximum brightness and minimum energy usage. Brightness appears to be related to pedestrians' perceived security in night-time outdoor spaces; thus brightness as a metric becomes a meaningful criterion for outdoor lighting.},

To understand the effect of light on appearance of paintings, few studies have experimented to establish a relation between pleasantness with the correlated colour temperature (CCT) of light. However, some studies have found that CCT has no significant effect on pleasant appearance of painting. Therefore, in this article, an experiment with a qualitative (questionnaire on semantic differential scale, N = 30) approach was designed to understand the effect of CCT on appearance of paintings exhibited under LED lights. The findings from the experimental result depict that the appearance of paintings changes due to different CCTs of LEDs having the same illuminance. In addition, the result reveals that for both mediums of paintings considered in this study, in comparison to warm white LED and artificial daylight LED, cool white LED has appeared to be more pleasant having moderately warm feelings to the viewers.},

  abstract = {Virtual Reality has great potential to become a usable design tool for the planning of light and colour in buildings. The technical development has provided us with better computer graphics and faster rendering techniques. However, the reliability and usability is delimited by lack of knowledge about how humans perceive spatial colour phenomena. The setting up of parameters for material properties in light calculation software is done arbitrarily. We present a comparison between a real room and a digital model evaluated on a desktop PC and in an Immersive Projection Technology (IPT) type system. Data were collected from video recorded interviews and questionnaires. The participants assessed the appearance of light, colours and space. They also evaluated their involvement in solving this task, and their presence in each environment. Our results highlight the benefits and disadvantages of the real and virtual models. The participants had difficulties in estimating the size of both the desktop room and the room in the ITP system. The comparison of real and virtual rooms revealed unsatisfying differences in shadowing and colour appearance. We defined the magnitude of perceived colour reflections in the real room, and elaborated with some of the parameters in Lightscape/3dsmax6.},

  abstract = {The blue cone pathway is reported to be affected early in Parkinson's disease (PD) and acquired type three (tritan) defects may occur. Sixty-one patients attending a treatment and rehabilitation centre for PD were examined with clinical colour vision tests. Seven of 13 patients, for whom the diagnosis of PD was equivocal or who had other medical conditions, were identified as having tritan colour deficiency. Results for the remaining 44 PD patients were compared with 40 age matched controls. Ten PD patients (22.7\%) had tritan defects. Tritan defects were not found in the control group but performance on some tests was age related. We conclude that clinical tests for tritan colour deficiency are unlikely to be helpful in identifying PD.},

These include effects relating to field size and illumination, the location of the test patch, level of adaptation of the eye and the degree of fixation or image stabilization employed. Related anomalies found in congenital colour deficiency and in defects acquired later in life due to diseases are also reviewed. The various phenomena of wavelength discrimination are then discussed in terms of four stages in the process of colour perception, namely the response of the retinal receptors, the transmission of the colour signals along the optic pathway to the brain, the generation of the colour sensations in the visual cortex, and the perception of the visual image. The material as a whole provides support for trichromatic theories of colour vision and implies the presence of three retinal processes with maximum sensitivity in the red, green and blue parts of the spectrum. There is, however, much to suggest that the process for red-green discrimination differs in some fundamental way from that responsible for the discrimination of blue from green.},

Elements of the background matrix of square cheeks are varied randomly in luminance in space and time to provide random luminance masking (RLM) which compensates for differences in the relative luminous efficiency of different observers. The measurement technique provides a rapid and comprehensive colour vision test. Typical results are presented for normal trichromats. protanopes and deuteranopes without RLM and with the RLM sel of 25\%. The size of the discrimination ellipse in normal observers is the same in both viewing conditions, hut the use of the RLM technique reveals the extent of the isochromatic zones in colour deficient observers.},

  abstract = {The areas of the brain that encode color categorically have not yet been reliably identified. Here, we used functional MRI adaptation to identify neuronal populations that represent color categories irrespective of metric differences in color. Two colors were successively presented within a block of trials. The two colors were either from the same or different categories (e.g., ``blue 1 and blue 2'' or ``blue 1 and green 1''), and the size of the hue difference was varied. Participants performed a target detection task unrelated to the difference in color. In the middle frontal gyrus of both hemispheres and to a lesser extent, the cerebellum, blood-oxygen level-dependent response was greater for colors from different categories relative to colors from the same category. Importantly, activation in these regions was not modulated by the size of the hue difference, suggesting that neurons in these regions represent color categorically, regardless of metric color difference. Representational similarity analyses, which investigated the similarity of the pattern of activity across local groups of voxels, identified other regions of the brain (including the visual cortex), which responded to metric but not categorical color differences. Therefore, categorical and metric hue differences appear to be coded in qualitatively different ways and in different brain regions. These findings have implications for the long-standing debate on the origin and nature of color categories, and also further our understanding of how color is processed by the brain.},

This paper presents the results of a I-year experiment using a towermounted spectroradiometer to measure the seasonal changes in the nadir reflectance properties of ash and beech canopies. Seasonal variations in reflectance in red wavelengths were found to be inversely related to percentage cover, whilst variations in near-infrared reflectance were directly related to percentage cover although for both wavelength regions changes in reflectance were not always exactly synchronous with changes in percentage cover. A strong rectilinear relation was observed between NDV( and percentage cover when data from both species were combined. The shape of the seasonal NOV! profile revealed differences between the two species that was ascribed to phenological differences between ash and beech canopies. The position of the wavelength of maximum slope in the region 680-750 nm, was found to shift between two domains depending on the particular association of scene clements presented to the sensor as canopy cover changed.},

We selected a set of color signals at different CCT of daylight for estimation. An experiment was conducted by generating color signals from 24 color samples of Macbeth Color Checker and 1645 daylight spectral power distributions (SPD), where CCT ranges from 3757K to 28322K. By uniform sampling of this, we collected 84 color signals from each color samples and combined them to form a training dataset. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) has been applied on the selected training dataset to find the basis vectors and the number of color signals needed for estimation. We apply the Wiener estimation with different order of polynomials to estimate the color signal of color samples. Interestingly, good estimation of all 1645 color signals of given color sample from Macbeth color chart is obtained by selecting five best CCT color signals of that given color sample and with association to its third order polynomial. However, the results from high order polynomials yield to significant errors on Wiener estimation.},

  abstract = {To what extent are sensory responses in the brain compatible with first-order principles? The efficient coding hypothesis projects that neurons use as few spikes as possible to faithfully represent natural stimuli. However, many sparsely firing neurons in higher brain areas seem to violate this hypothesis in that they respond more to familiar stimuli than to nonfamiliar stimuli. We reconcile this discrepancy by showing that efficient sensory responses give rise to stimulus selectivity that depends on the stimulus-independent firing threshold and the balance between excitatory and inhibitory inputs. We construct a cost function that enforces minimal firing rates in model neurons by linearly punishing suprathreshold synaptic currents. By contrast, subthreshold currents are punished quadratically, which allows us to optimally reconstruct sensory inputs from elicited responses. We train synaptic currents on many renditions of a particular bird's own song (BOS) and few renditions of conspecific birds' songs (CONs). During training, model neurons develop a response selectivity with complex dependence on the firing threshold. At low thresholds, they fire densely and prefer CON and the reverse BOS (REV) over BOS. However, at high thresholds or when hyperpolarized, they fire sparsely and prefer BOS over REV and over CON. Based on this selectivity reversal, our model suggests that preference for a highly familiar stimulus corresponds to a high-threshold or strong-inhibition regime of an efficient coding strategy. Our findings apply to songbird mirror neurons, and in general, they suggest that the brain may be endowed with simple mechanisms to rapidly change selectivity of neural responses to focus sensory processing on either familiar or nonfamiliar stimuli. In summary, we find support for the efficient coding hypothesis and provide new insights into the interplay between the sparsity and selectivity of neural responses.},

Previous perceptual studies have assumed that the brain analyses the colour of a surface independently of its three-dimensional shape and viewing geometry, although there are neural connections between colour and two-dimensional form processing early in the visual pathway. Here we show that colour perception is strongly influenced by three-dimensional shape perception in a novel, chromatic version of the Mach Card\textemdash a concave folded card with one side made of magenta paper and the other of white paper. The light reflected from the magenta paper casts a pinkish glow on the white side. The perceived colour of the white side changes from pale pink to deep magenta when the perceived shape of the card flips from concave to convex. The effect demonstrates that the human visual system incorporates knowledge of mutual illumination\textemdash the physics of light reflection between surfaces\textemdash at an early stage in colour perception.},

The current study aimed to understand how gamification affects the user experience, specifically during the undertaking of psychophysical tasks designed to estimate vision thresholds (chromatic and achromatic contrast sensitivity). Methods: Three tablet computer-based games were developed with three levels of gaming elements. Game 1 was designed to be a simple clinical test (no gaming elements), game 2 was similar to game 1 but with added gaming elements (i.e., feedback, scores, and sounds), and game 3 was a complete game. Participants (N\,=\,144, age: 9.9\textendash 42 years) played three games in random order. The user experience for each game was assessed using a Short Feedback Questionnaire. Results: The median (interquartile range) fun level for the three games was 2.5 (1.6), 3.9 (1.7), and 2.5 (2.8), respectively. Overall, participants reported greater fun level and higher preparedness to play the game again for game 2 than games 1 and 3 (P\,{$<$}\,0.05). There were significant positive correlations observed between fun level and preparedness to play the game again for all the games (p\,{$<$}\,0.05). Engagement (assessed as completion rates) did not differ between the games. Conclusion: Gamified version (game 2) was preferred to the other two versions. Over the short term, the careful application of gaming elements to vision tests was found to increase the fun level of users, without affecting engagement with the vision test.}

  abstract = {Tablet computer displays are amenable for the development of vision tests in a portable form. Assessing color vision using an easily accessible and portable test may help in the self-monitoring of vision-related changes in ocular/systemic conditions and assist in the early detection of disease processes. Tablet computer-based games were developed with different levels of gamification as a more portable option to assess chromatic contrast sensitivity. Game 1 was designed as a clinical version with no gaming elements. Game 2 was a gamified version of game 1 (added fun elements: feedback, scores, and sounds) and game 3 was a complete game with vision task nested within. The current study aimed to determine the normative values and evaluate repeatability of the tablet computer-based games in comparison with an established test, the Cambridge Colour Test (CCT) Trivector test. Normally sighted individuals [N = 100, median (range) age 19.0 years (18\textendash 56 years)] had their chromatic contrast sensitivity evaluated binocularly using the three games and the CCT. Games 1 and 2 and the CCT showed similar absolute thresholds and tolerance intervals, and game 3 had significantly lower values than games 1, 2, and the CCT, due to visual task differences. With the exception of game 3 for blue-yellow, the CCT and tablet computer-based games showed similar repeatability with comparable 95\% limits of agreement. The custom-designed games are portable, rapid, and may find application in routine clinical practice, especially for testing younger populations.},

  abstract = {The lateral geniculate nucleus is thought to represent color using two populations of cone-opponent neurons [L vs M; S vs (L + M)], which establish the cardinal directions in color space (reddish vs cyan; lavender vs lime). How is this representation transformed to bring about color perception? Prior work implicates populations of glob cells in posterior inferior temporal cortex (PIT; the V4 complex), but the correspondence between the neural representation of color in PIT/V4 complex and the organization of perceptual color space is unclear. We compared color-tuning data for populations of glob cells and interglob cells to predictions obtained using models that varied in the color-tuning narrowness of the cells, and the color preference distribution across the populations. Glob cells were best accounted for by simulated neurons that have nonlinear (narrow) tuning and, as a population, represent a color space designed to be perceptually uniform (CIELUV). Multidimensional scaling and representational similarity analyses showed that the color space representations in both glob and interglob populations were correlated with the organization of CIELUV space, but glob cells showed a stronger correlation. Hue could be classified invariant to luminance with high accuracy given glob responses and above-chance accuracy given interglob responses. Luminance could be read out invariant to changes in hue in both populations, but interglob cells tended to prefer stimuli having luminance contrast, regardless of hue, whereas glob cells typically retained hue tuning as luminance contrast was modulated. The combined luminance/hue sensitivity of glob cells is predicted for neurons that can distinguish two colors of the same hue at different luminance levels (orange/brown).},

  abstract = {This study looks at the perceived quality of light-emitting diode (LED)-based lighting of various colors. The objective was to find out whether LEDs could provide better (i.e., more relevant and acceptable) lighting than that which is obtained with standard halogen or fluorescent sources. The perception of objects was assessed under different lighting schemes. Subjects were invited to add red, cyan and/or amber to white LED-based light to match the halogen and fluorescence rendering on specific targets: a color chart and a painting. They were also asked to rate the difference between the two, and to express their preference. The results obtained for the perception of LED-based lighting were quite positive. Color blendings of LED light were found to provide illuminated situations similar to halogens or fluorescent sources. These blendings were well accepted, and indeed often preferred, although the color rendering index (CRI) was always low. This indicates that the CRI as it stands is inadequate to characterize the color rendering of solid-state light sources, and needs to be updated. LED-based lighting systems seem to have considerable potential for use in shops and display units, where they may well outperform existing lighting systems. \textcopyright{} 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

  abstract = {Increasingly, museums are installing energy-saving light sources, such as LED (light emitting diode) lamps. LEDs represent an evolving technology; there are concerns about the effects of light spectra on artifacts, including textiles. Many LED models do not possess the same color rendering properties that observers are accustomed to, and it is important to understand the effects that spectra can play on dyed textiles. This research focuses on the visual effects of different light spectra, including those of LEDs, on textile colorants in order to gauge the range of color differences produced. Nine early synthetic dyes and one commercial fading standard were utilized. This paper summarizes our findings to date: that LED spectra with the same color temperature can render very different observable colors, especially with saturated colors. Saturated purples were found to be extremely hard to render accurately with LEDs. Other hues may also be compromised. Experimental work indicates that color temperature, illuminance level, and the commercial Color Rendering Index (CRI) are insufficient specifications for exhibitions LED light sources. An instrumental method for assessing LEDs before exhibition installation is suggested.},

In a simulation study, we show that including data from control groups of previous studies could halve the minimum sample size required to reach the canonical 80\% power or increase power when using the same number of animals. We validated the approach on a dataset based on seven independent rodent studies on the cognitive effects of early-life adversity.

  abstract = {Dichromatic subjects can name colors accurately, even though they cannot discriminate among red-green hues (Jameson \& Hurvich, 1978). This result is attributed to a normative language system that dichromatic observers developed by learning subtle visual cues to compensate for their impoverished color system. The present study used multidimensional scaling techniques to compare color categorization spaces of color-vision deficient (CVD) subjects to those of normal trichromat (NT) subjects, and consensus analysis estimated the normative effect of language on categorization. Subjects sorted 140 Munsell color samples in three different ways: a free sorting task (unlimited number of categories), a constrained sorting task (number of categories limited to eight), and a constrained naming task (limited to eight basic color terms). CVD color categories were comparable to those of NT subjects. For both CVD and NT subjects, a common color categorization space derived from the three tasks was well described by a three-dimensional model, with the first two dimensions corresponding to reddish-greenish and yellowish-bluish axes. However, the third axis, which was associated with an achromatic dimension in NTs, was not identified in the CVD model. Individual differences multidimensional scaling failed to reveal group differences in the sorting tasks. In contrast, the personal color naming spaces of CVD subjects exhibited a relative compression of the yellowish-bluish dimension that is inconsistent with the typical deutan-type color spaces derived from more direct measures of perceptual color judgments. As expected, the highest consensus among CVDs (77\%) and NTs (82\%) occurred in the naming task. The categorization behaviors studied in this experiment seemed to rely more on learning factors, and may reveal little about CVD perceptual representation of colors.},

The power spectra of the daylights are low pass with more than 99\% of spectral power below 1 cycle/300 nm and 99.9\% below 3 cycles/300 nm. The power spectra of reflectance functions are also low pass with more than 99\% of spectral power below 4 cycles/300 nm and 99.9\% below 11 cycles/300 nm. Consequently, the resulting color signals are typically low pass with, for our samples, an estimated frequency cutoff of 5 cycles/300 nm. Theoretical and experimental data concerning human chromatic response in the frequency domain show that this limit corresponds to the highest frequency that the color system can resolve. The implications for normal and abnormal human color vision are discussed.},

  abstract = {Correlated colour temperature is a one-dimensional description of the colour of near-white light sources. The concept relates the numerical value to a visual observation of smallest colour difference between the chromaticity of the test source and of a point lying on the Planckian locus. In practice, chromaticity difference on a uniform chromaticity scale diagram is used. Since the introduction of the CIELUV and CIELAB spaces, it has been questioned whether the calculations should be done on the traditional u,v diagram, or by using a more equidistant colour space. Based on our visual experiments, we can state that the u,v diagram-based calculation is adequate to describe the correlated colour temperature of a source. The individual scatter of observations is so large that a visual definition has no practical reality. Thus, we recommend changing the definition of correlated colour temperature from a visual definition to a mathematical one and dropping any reference to visual investigations. \textcopyright{} 2001 John Wiley \& Sons, Inc.

We present results from two experiments that undermine existing behavioral evidence to separate the unique hues from other colors. In Experiment 1 we used hue scaling, which has often been used to support the existence of unique hues, but has never been attempted with a set of non-unique primaries. Subjects were assigned to one of two experimental conditions. In the \&\#x201C;unique\&\#x201D; condition, they rated the proportions of red, yellow, blue, and green that they perceived in each of a series of test stimuli. In the \&\#x201C;intermediate\&\#x201D; condition, they rated the proportions of teal, purple, orange, and lime. We found, surprisingly, that results from the two conditions were largely equivalent. In Experiment 2, we investigated the effect of instruction on subjects\&\#x2019; settings of unique hues. We found that altering the color terms given in the instructions to include intermediate hues led to significant shifts in the hue that subjects identified as unique. The results of both experiments question subjects\&\#x2019; abilities to identify certain hues as unique.},

Following the method of Malkoc et\&\#xA0;al. (J. Opt. Soc. Am. A22, 2154 [2005]), we gathered unique and binary hue selections from 50 subjects. For these subjects we repeated the measurements in two separate sessions, allowing us to measure test\&\#x2013;retest reliabilities (0.52\&\#x2264;\&\#x3C1;\&\#x2264;0.78; p\&\#x226A;0.01). We quantified the within-individual variability for selections of each hue. Adjusting for the differences in variability intrinsic to different regions of chromaticity space, we compared the within-individual variability for unique hues to that for binary hues. Surprisingly, we found that selections of unique hues did not show consistently lower variability than selections of binary hues. We repeated hue measurements in a single session for an independent sample of 58 subjects, using a different relative scaling of the cardinal axes of MacLeod\&\#x2013;Boynton chromaticity space. Again, we found no consistent difference in adjusted within-individual variability for selections of unique and binary hues. Our finding does not depend on the particular scaling chosen for the Y axis of MacLeod\&\#x2013;Boynton chromaticity space.},

For this reason, linear models with a small number of bases (5-8) are frequently used for representation and estimation of these functions. In other signal representation and recovery applications, it has been recently demonstrated that dictionary based sparse representations can outperform linear model approaches. In this paper, we describe methods for building dictionaries for sparse estimation of reflectance functions. We describe a method for building dictionaries that account for the measurement system; in estimation applications these dictionaries outperform the ones designed for sparse representation without accounting for the measurement system. Sparse recovery methods typically outperform traditional linear methods by 20-40\% (in terms of RMSE).},

The lake, the deepest (1600 m) and one of the largest and most ancient in the world, is unique in that the oxygen levels at the bottom are only reduced to about 80\% of the surface levels. We have studied, by light microscopy, microspectrophotometry and visual pigment extraction, the retinas from 17 species of Baikal cottoids that live at different depths within the lake. Generally the retinas contain, in addition to rods, large green-sensitive double cones and small blue-sensitive single cones: surprisingly for freshwater fish, the visual pigments are based on Vitamin A1 The {$\lambda$}max of both rods and cones are displaced to shorter wavelengths with increasing depth. Surface species have cones with {$\lambda$}max at about 546,525 and 450 nm and rods at 523 nm, deeper living species retain cones, but with {$\lambda$}max shifting towards 500 and 425 nm and with rods at 480 nm, whereas the deepest living fish possess only rods ({$\lambda$}max, 480\textendash 500 nm). These data clearly show a correlation between photoreceptor complement, visual pigment {$\lambda$}max, and depth, but question the hypothesis that there is a correlation of pigment ({$\lambda$}max with water colour since, in contrast to oceanic waters, the maximum transmission of Baikal water is between 550 and 600 nm.},

This scrutiny has focused largely on the environmental consequences, with little consideration of the benefits of lighting. Human Factors in Lighting, Third Edition restores some balance to the discussion by examining the ways in which people interact with lighting. These interactions influence the ability to perform visual tasks; the perception of people, objects, and spaces; human comfort and behavior; as well as human health and safety. It is only by understanding how to use light to achieve these ends that lighting can be provided effectively and efficiently to the benefit of all. See What's New in the Third Edition:   New chapters on the non-image-forming system, lighting for pedestrians, light pollution, and lighting and electricity use  Revision of all other chapters to update them to take into account the advances that have been made in our understanding of the effects of light on people over the last decade  Integration of the combined effects of light via the visual and non-image-forming systems on performance and perception   The book covers both the visual and the non-visual effects of light on people as well as the benefits of lighting and the costs it imposes on the environment. It details the consequences of exposure to lighting or lighting technology and the role of exposure to light on such basic functions of the body as circadian rhythms. The author combines information from many different sources and integrates them into a coherent overview of lighting practice that can be used to develop better lighting solutions at a lower environmental cost.},

I. A. MacLeod and initially proposed by the author to the CIE in 1979. This proposal led to the formation of a CIE committee to consider an ideal version of the system, to be employed either as a supplement to, or an alternative for, the 1931 ``standard observer.'' After 15 years, the task remains unfinished. The history of debate within the original committee and that of its successor (which is still active today) is briefly reviewed. Among cone fundamentals that might be chosen, a set derived and published by Stockman, MacLeod, and Johnson [ J. Opt. Soc. Am. A10, 2491 ( 1993)] is favored here, and some of the advantages for displaying visual data in a system based on these fundamentals are illustrated.

  abstract = {The visual system employs a gain control mechanism in the cortical coding of contrast whereby the response of each cell is normalised by the integrated activity of neighbouring cells. While restricted in space, the normalisation pool is broadly tuned for spatial frequency and orientation, so that a cell's response is adapted by stimuli which fall outside its `classical' receptive field. Various functions have been attributed to divisive gain control: in this paper we consider whether this output nonlinearity serves to increase the information carrying capacity of the neural code. 46 natural scenes were analysed with the use of oriented, frequency-tuned filters whose bandwidths were chosen to match those of mammalian striate cortical cells. The images were logarithmically transformed so that the filters responded to a luminance ratio or contrast. In the first study, the response of each filter was calibrated relative to its response to a grating stimulus, and local image contrast was expressed in terms of the familiar Michelson metric. We found that the distribution of contrasts in natural images is highly kurtotic, peaking at low values and having a long exponential tail. There is considerable variability in local contrast, both within and between images. In the second study we compared the distribution of response activity before and after implementing contrast normalisation, and noted two major changes. Response variability, both within and between scenes, is reduced by normalisation, and the entropy of the response distribution is increased after normalisation, indicating a more efficient transfer of information.},

  abstract = {We argue that critical areas of memory research rely on problematic measurement practices and provide concrete suggestions to improve the situation. In particular, we highlight the prevalence of memory studies that use tasks (like the ``old/new'' task: ``have you seen this item before? yes/no'') where quantifying performance is deeply dependent on counterfactual reasoning that depends on the (unknowable) distribution of underlying memory signals. As a result of this difficulty, different literatures in memory research (e.g., visual working memory, eyewitness identification, picture memory, etc.) have settled on a variety of fundamentally different metrics to get performance measures from such tasks (e.g., A{${'}$}, corrected hit rate, percent correct, d{${'}$}, diagnosticity ratios, K values, etc.), even though these metrics make different, contradictory assumptions about the distribution of latent memory signals, and even though all of their assumptions are frequently incorrect. We suggest that in order for the psychology and neuroscience of memory to become a more cumulative, theory-driven science, more attention must be given to measurement issues. We make a concrete suggestion: The default memory task for those simply interested in performance should change from old/new (``did you see this item'?'') to two-alternative forced-choice (``which of these two items did you see?''). In situations where old/new variants are preferred (e.g., eyewitness identification; theoretical investigations of the nature of memory signals), receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis should be performed rather than a binary old/new task.},

  abstract = {When remembering a real-world scene, people encode both detailed information about specific objects and higher order information like the overall gist of the scene. However, formal models of change detection, like those used to estimate visual working memory capacity, assume observers encode only a simple memory representation that includes no higher order structure and treats items independently from one another. We present a probabilistic model of change detection that attempts to bridge this gap by formalizing the role of perceptual organization and allowing for richer, more structured memory representations. Using either standard visual working memory displays or displays in which the items are purposefully arranged in patterns, we find that models that take into account perceptual grouping between items and the encoding of higher order summary information are necessary to account for human change detection performance. Considering the higher order structure of items in visual working memory will be critical for models to make useful predictions about observers' memory capacity and change detection abilities in simple displays as well as in more natural scenes.},

  abstract = {The photopigment in the human eye that transduces light for circadian and neuroendocrine regulation, is unknown. The aim of this study was to establish an action spectrum for light-induced melatonin suppression that could help elucidate the ocular photoreceptor system for regulating the human pineal gland. Subjects (37 females, 35 males, mean age of 24.5 {$\pm$} 0.3 years) were healthy and had normal color vision. Full-field, monochromatic light exposures took place between 2:00 and 3:30 A.M. while subjects' pupils were dilated. Blood samples collected before and after light exposures were quantified for melatonin. Each subject was tested with at least seven different irradiances of one wavelength with a minimum of 1 week between each nighttime exposure. Nighttime melatonin suppression tests (n = 627) were completed with wavelengths from 420 to 600 nm. The data were fit to eight univariant, sigmoidal fluence\textendash response curves (R 2 = 0.81\textendash 0.95). The action spectrum constructed from these data fit an opsin template (R 2 = 0.91), which identifies 446\textendash 477 nm as the most potent wavelength region providing circadian input for regulating melatonin secretion. The results suggest that, in humans, a single photopigment may be primarily responsible for melatonin suppression, and its peak absorbance appears to be distinct from that of rod and cone cell photopigments for vision. The data also suggest that this new photopigment is retinaldehyde based. These findings suggest that there is a novel opsin photopigment in the human eye that mediates circadian photoreception.},

We formulate computational color constancy as a statistical estimation problem. We assume that the likelihood that any particular illuminant or surface will occur in a scene is governed by a prior probability distribution. In particular, we assume that illuminant spectral power distributions are drawn according to multivariate normal distribution over the weights of a finite dimensional linear model, and similarly for surface reflectance functions. Given a set of photosensor responses, Bayes rule may be applied to derive the posterior distribution for illuminants and surfaces. We discuss how to use the posterior to estimate the illuminant. We use simulation to compare the performance of a Bayesian algorithm to that of two previously reported color constancy algorithms. For our simulation conditions, the Bayesian algorithm results in the smallest expected estimation error.},

To provide useful perceptual representations, the brain must go beyond the measurements and make inferences about the scene being viewed. This article considers the first stages of spatiochromatic vision. We show how spatial and chromatic information become intertwined by the optics of the eye and because of the structure of the retinal cone mosaic, and we consider the consequent implications for perception. Because there is at most one cone at each retinal location, the standard treatment of human trichromacy does not apply at fine spatial scales. Rather, trichromacy results from a perceptual inference based on measurements from cones of different classes at different locations. Our treatment emphasizes linking physics, biology, and computation with the goal of providing a framework for a larger understanding of how the brain interprets photoreceptor excitations to see objects and their properties.},

  abstract = {This article describes the characterization and use of computer-controlled displays. Most imaging devices are now computer controlled, and this makes it possible for the computer to take into account the properties of the imaging device to achieve the intended image. CRT (cathode ray tube) monitors is emphasizes the article begins with the standard model of CRT imaging. How this model may be used to render the desired visual image accurately from its numerical representation is shown. The domain of validity of the standard CRT model is discussed. The model makes several assumptions about monitor performance that are usually valid but can fail for certain images and CRTs. How to detect such failures and how to cope with them are explained. Primarily users who will be doing accurate imaging on a CRT are addressed. CRTs are very well suited for accurate rendering. Treatment of LCDs (liquid crystal displays) is brief, in part because this technology is changing very rapidly and in part because the strong dependence of emitted light on viewing angle in current LCD displays is a great obstacle to accurate rendering. Plasma displays seem more promising in this regard. All the steps of a basic characterization are presented. The treatment emphasizes accuracy both in color and in space. The display characteristics that need to be taken into account to present an arbitrary spatiotemporal image accurately, that is, luminance and chromaticity as a function of space and time are reviewed. A number of topics of interest to the vision scientist who requires precise control of a displayed stimulus are treated. This article explains the standard CRT model (and necessary basic colorimetry) and describes simple visual tests (available online) that establish the model's validity for a monitor. How to use the standard model to characterize your display for accurate rendering is shown. Finally, the discussion briefly presents several more advanced topics, including characterization of non-CRT displays.},

  abstract = {The aim of this study was to test if the three cone photopic visual system is the primary ocular photoreceptor input for human circadian regulation by determining the effects of different wavelengths on light-induced melatonin suppression. Healthy subjects with stable sleeping patterns (wake-up time 7:30 AM {$\pm$} 12 min) and normal color vision were exposed at night to full-field 505 nm or 555 nm monochromatic stimuli or darkness for 90 min. Plasma collected before and after exposures was quantified for melatonin. Subjects exposed to 10 irradiances at 505 nm showed no significant differences across mean pre-exposure melatonin values (F=0.505). A sigmoidal fluence-response curve fitted to the melatonin suppression data (R2=0.97) indicated that 9.34 \texttimes{} 1012 photons/cm2/sec induced a half-saturation response (ED50) while 6.84 \texttimes{} 1013 photons/cm2/sec induced a saturation melatonin suppression response. Further, a dose of 4.19 \texttimes{} 1013 photon/cm2/sec at 505 nm was significantly stronger (P {$<$} 0.01) than an equal photon dose at 555 nm for melatonin suppression. These data demonstrate that the cone system that mediates human photopic vision is not the primary photoreceptor system to tranduce light stimuli for melatonin regulation.},

  abstract = {In this study, we systematically review the scientific literature on the effect of color on object recognition. Thirty-five independent experiments, comprising 1535 participants, were included in a meta-analysis. We found a moderate effect of color on object recognition (d=0.28). Specific effects of moderator variables were analyzed and we found that color diagnosticity is the factor with the greatest moderator effect on the influence of color in object recognition; studies using color diagnostic objects showed a significant color effect (d=0.43), whereas a marginal color effect was found in studies that used non-color diagnostic objects (d=0.18). The present study did not permit the drawing of specific conclusions about the moderator effect of the object recognition task; while the meta-analytic review showed that color information improves object recognition mainly in studies using naming tasks (d=0.36), the literature review revealed a large body of evidence showing positive effects of color information on object recognition in studies using a large variety of visual recognition tasks. We also found that color is important for the ability to recognize artifacts and natural objects, to recognize objects presented as types (line-drawings) or as tokens (photographs), and to recognize objects that are presented without surface details, such as texture or shadow. Taken together, the results of the meta-analysis strongly support the contention that color plays a role in object recognition. This suggests that the role of color should be taken into account in models of visual object recognition.},

  abstract = {Moral dilemma judgements frequently involve decisions where moral norms and the greater good are in conflict. The current preregistered study tested the effect of the steroid hormone testosterone on moral dilemma judgements using a double-blind administration of testosterone or placebo. Counter to predictions, testosterone administration led to increased inaction in moral dilemmas where harmful actions prohibited by moral norms increase overall well-being. Using a mathematical model to disentangle sensitivity to consequences, sensitivity to moral norms and general preference for inaction versus action, analyses further revealed that testosterone administration influenced judgements by increasing sensitivity to moral norms. Exploratory analyses suggested the opposite pattern for endogenous testosterone measured at baseline, in that higher levels of endogenous testosterone were associated with lower sensitivity to moral norms. The results indicate that the role of testosterone in moral judgements is more complex than suggested by previous findings.},

The analysis on solar radiation data and models showed that the current climate files under-estimate all irradiance components, whereas a combination of Met Office data and the Skartveit separation model can drastically improve irradiance estimates.

In the present study we examined two aspects of color vision that presumably reflect cortical connectivity. In the first part of this article we show that chromatic induction was also unaffected: a blue surrounding made a gray target appear to be yellow to the monkey. At five months of age, the deprived monkey did not readily use color to recognize objects, although it was able to do so if necessary. In the second part of this article we show that, as an adult, the monkey was quite willing to use color to categorize objects. We conclude that early color deprivation does not result in long lasting deficits in color vision.},

Furthermore, models of chromatic adaptation are not so illuminant invariant as other models of color vision.

  abstract = {Previous attempts to predict chromatic-adaptation correspondence have led to a sharpening dilemma\textemdash i.e., Von Kries primaries are chosen that do not include in the positive octant all the realizable (x,y) chromaticities. This leads to paradoxical adaptation predictions for the colors that have negative Von Kries coordinates. A solution is proposed here that expresses the asymmetric-matching relation of chromatic adaptation as the product of two matrix transformations, given source illuminant 1 and destination illuminant 2: from source tristimulus values via adaptation matrix 1 to the adapted state coordinates, and from the adapted state via the inverse of adaptation matrix 2 to the destination illuminant tristimulus values. To avoid the sharpening instability, the entire spectrum locus must lie within the positive octant of the adapted state tristimulus space. \textcopyright{} 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

  abstract = {The eminence of Herbert Eugene Ives has been a cascading influence over color science, and particularly over activities in the CIE, throughout this century. Ives is well known for having been the first to measure the luminosity function, nine years before Guild's measurements became the basis of the first CIE standard. He also represented in explicit equation form the algebra of transforming primaries in trstimulus space and representing the transformation in projective chromaticity coordinates. [Ives was not the first to discuss such transformations, for they had been implicit in Grassmann's laws and in Maxwell's color triangle since the middle of the nineteenth century. However, he rendered the rather abstract geometry into a form readily accessible to engineers.] In addition, Ives was a pioneer in the art and science of simulating daylight byplacing filters in front of tungsten illumination sources. Finally, about thirty years ahead of his time, Ives anticipated the Fourier approach to timedependence in vision. However, a lesser-known achievement of Ives was his contribution to the technology and assessment of color rendering by light sources. In particular, this work comprised what may be the first computational test of von Kries's theory of color constancy. This early work, which contained a startling number of the in gredients of modern work in color constancy, is reprinted as this month's Classical Article. Ives had neither good standard apparatus for measuring spectral reflectance, nor the convenience of a computer. Therefore, he invented piecewise-constant reflectance spectra that were plausible in the sense of having values between 0.1 and 1, and three or fewer transitions across the visible spectrum (see Fig. 3). to obtain reflected-light tristimulus values in the absence of CIE color-matching functions, he first multiplied Koenig's sprimary-sensation curves by two illuminant spectral power distributions (see Fig. 1) to get what Worthey called much later ``object-color matching functions.'' He then summed the values over wavelength, weighted by the block reflectances, to obtain the tristimulus values. the differences in chromaticity for the same reflectance under the two different illuminants are recorded in Fig. 4 as ``colorimetric shifts.'' Although these colorimetric shifts are mathematically definite and useful quantities to compute, Ives realized that, in themselves, they do not represent changes in color percepts under change of illumination. Rather, the visual system undergoes an adaptation to the prevailing illumination that transforms the measured chromaticities of reflected lights to other values. This transformation implements Helmholtz's ``discounting of the illuminant,'' an attempt of the visual system to restore the visual representation of object reflectances to illuminant-independent positions in the space of perceived colors. As a particular way to discount the illuminant (and hence to achieve what is known as color constancy), Ives chose to divide each tristimulus value of a reflected light by the corresponding tristimulus value of a white (with a reflectance of 1 across the spectrum). This algorithm, an application of von Kries's model of chromatic adaptation,6,7 certainly sends the illuminant unerringly to the point (1, 1, 1), independent of the spectrum of the illuminant. However, the algorithm does not perform of satisfactorily on other reflectance spectra. Although the colorimetric shifts are reduced by the von Kries adaptation, there are still residual shifts (see Fig. 5). This kind of analysis is quite revealing of the limitations of color constancy, especially constancy of the von Kries sort. an analysis of the same sort on measured reflectance spectra was not done until the work of Helson, et al. in 1952. Other analyses followed, stimulated by the retinex theory of Edwin Land and including the work of McCann, McKee, and Taylor and Worthey. of course, the question remained unanswered and hotly debated as to how the visual system infers the tristimulus values of the white object that it uses as the denominator in the von Kries adaptation; this has been discussed by Land, McCann, and Brainard and Wandell, among others. Another question is to define the spectral assumptions (for illuminants, reflectances, and color-matching functions) under which the colorimetric shifts would reduce to zero for nonwhite reflectances. Much has been written in this area, including the following kinds of assumptions: (a) reflectances, color-matching functions, and illuminant spectra that are piecewise constant over the same bands in the visible spectrum; (b) very narrowband color-matching functions, but unconstrained illuminants and reflectances;16,17 (c) reflectance spectra that are designed to avoid a ``forbidden subspace'' dictated by the (unconstrained) illuminant spectra and color-matching functions; and finally (d) reflectance and illuminant spectra that must be linear combinations of two and three basis functions (respectively), or the reverse, and the measured color-matching functions are linearly combined to achieve the von Kries invariance.19,20 Other simulations have also been done with models different from that of von Kries, starting with Helson, et al., and commencing with more modern theories.22,23,24 (See Pokorny, et al. for an excellent review of the more modern theories.) Such is the legacy of the article by Ives. The reader of Ives's article will note the claim to priority at the beginning of the second paragraph. to my best knowledge, this claim is true, and can be trusted even though Ives has not referred to any prior investigators by explicit citation (even to the article by Koenig or to the theory of von Kries). the reader will also note that the author refers to his own ongoing work in daylight simulation using filters that was to appear two years later in finished form. However, I have learned from Calvin McCamy of earlier work on daylight design that was not referenced by Ives.27,28 Perhaps Ives viewed his article as apractical note for engineers rather than as a scholarly tract. A historical question I have not yet completely resolved is whether von Kries viewed his transformation as a vehicle to Helmholtz's discounting of the illuminant, or whether von Kries viewed his transformation merely as offering degrees of freedom that would reveal the particular linear combination of color-matching functions that are receptor fundamentals. If the latter were true, then Ives may have been the first to use the von Kries transformation in a theory of color constancy. the Englishtranslated von Kries articles with which we are familiar do not discuss color constancy. History seems to have given only rare acknowledgment to Ives's ``Color of the illuminant'' article. In fact, it was only by reading the scholarly review in Helson, et al. that I became aware of the article at all. the reason for this paucity of acknowledgment can hardly be Ives's lack of eminence in his own time. Rather, it seems that his methodology in this particular article was well ahead of its time, even by the standards of his other early work that presaged the methods of the CIE. Readers who are interested in more complete accounts of the life and accomplishments of Herbert E. Ives may consult the testimonial upon his receipt of the Ives medal (named after his father, and given by the Optical Society of America), and also might find helpful the journal obituary. In particular, Ives was quite critical of Einstein's theory; he published over 30 papers about relativity starting the year he received the Ives medal, which have been reprinted with commentary. His publication list includes subjects as diverse as television, spectroscopy and Special Relativity. Much more could be written in a more generalized context about the contributions of Herbert E. Ives.},

  abstract = {We have previously documented the exquisite motion sensitivity of neurons in extrastriate area MT by studying the relationship between their responses and the direction and strength of visual motion signals delivered to their receptive fields. These results suggested that MT neurons might provide the signals supporting behavioral choice in visual discrimination tasks. To approach this question from another direction, we have now studied the relationship between the discharge of MT neurons and behavioral choice, independently of the effects of visual stimulation. We found that trial-to-trial variability in neuronal signals was correlated with the choices the monkey made. Therefore, when a directionally selective neuron in area MT fires more vigorously, the monkey is more likely to make a decision in favor of the preferred direction of the cell. The magnitude of the relationship was modest, on average, but was highly significant across a sample of 299 cells from four monkeys. The relationship was present for all stimuli (including those without a net motion signal), and for all but the weakest responses. The relationship was reduced or eliminated when the demands of the task were changed so that the directional signal carried by the cell was less informative. The relationship was evident within 50 ms of response onset, and persisted throughout the stimulus presentation. On average, neurons that were more sensitive to weak motion signals had a stronger relationship to behavior than those that were less sensitive. These observations are consistent with the idea that neuronal signals in MT are used by the monkey to determine the direction of stimulus motion. The modest relationship between behavioral choice and the discharge of any one neuron, and the prevalence of the relationship across the population, make it likely that signals from many neurons are pooled to form the data on which behavioral choices are based.},

  abstract = {Where are we to look for the unique hues? Out in the world? In the eye? In more central processing? 1. There are difficulties looking for the structure of the unique hues in simple combinations of cone-response functions like (L\,-\,M) and (S\,-\,(L\,+\,M)): such functions may fit pretty well the early physiological processing, but they don't correspond to the structure of unique hues. It may seem more promising to look to, e.g., Hurvich \& Jameson's `chromatic response functions'; but these report on psychophysical behaviour, not on underlying physiology. So `opponent processing' isn't any particular help on the unique hues\textemdash and even physiology in general seems not to have come up with any good correlate or explanation. 2. Wright (Review of Philosophy and Psychology 2: 1\textendash 17, 2011) looks in a different place: to (a) magnitude of total visual response that a stimulus light provokes, the maxima and minima of which, he thinks, give us the boundaries of the main hue categories (Wright connects these with Thornton's `prime' and `antiprime' colours in an illuminant: Journal of the Optical Society of America 61 (1971): 1155\textendash 1163); and (b) the ratio of chromatic to achromatic response, the maxima and minima of which, he suggests, give us the focal points of the unique hues. The suggestions are extremely interesting; but the desired correspondences have some counterexamples; and where they hold, one could wonder how much they depend upon the particular choice of functions to measure (a) and (b); and one could hope for more of an explanatory linkage between the sets of items in question. 3. Could the unique hues come from, so to speak, the external world? White and black can easily be defined as particular kinds of reflectance. What of the standard four unique hues? Variation in kinds of sunlight and skylight coincides well with variation along a line from unique yellow to unique blue (cf. Shepard 1992, Mollon 2006). If we wanted something to calibrate our standards for unique yellow and blue as the lens of the eye changes with age, and despite interpersonal cone differences, this would be a good basis\textemdash and there are several ways this can be extended to surface colours. But is there any essential connection between these things: is there any rationale why the light of the sun and the sky should be counted as unique hued? An answer may be: because in our environment, these illuminants are as close to white (or the natural illuminant colour) as you can get\textemdash to see things tinged with sunlight or skylight should be to see them minimally tinged with any alien colour. Whereas other hues in an illuminant would be treated as tinging with a more alien colour the thing seen.},

  abstract = {Cortical activity was measured with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) while human subjects viewed 12 stimulus colors and performed either a color-naming or diverted attention task. A forward model was used to extract lower dimensional neural color spaces from the high-dimensional fMRI responses. The neural color spaces in two visual areas, human ventral V4 (V4v) and VO1, exhibited clustering (greater similarity between activity patterns evoked by stimulus colors within a perceptual category, compared to between-category colors) for the color-naming task, but not for the diverted attention task. Response amplitudes and signal-to-noise ratios were higher in most visual cortical areas for color naming compared to diverted attention. But only in V4v and VO1 did the cortical representation of color change to a categorical color space. A model is presented that induces such a categorical representation by changing the response gains of subpopulations of color-selective neurons.},

  abstract = {Background: The perceived color at each point in a visual scene depends on the relationship between light signals from that point, and light signals from surrounding areas of the scene. In the well known phenomenon of simultaneous color contrast, changing the overall brightness or hue of an object's surround induces a complementary shift in the perceived brightness or hue of the object's color. Color contrast is thought to contribute to color constancy with changes in illumination. Results: We report a new type of simultaneous color contrast, in which changing only the variance (i.e. contrasts and saturations), but not the mean, of colors in a test spot's surround induces a complementary shift in the perceived contrast and saturation of the test spot's color. Objects appear much more vivid and richly colored against low-contrast, gray surrounds than against high-contrast, multicolored surrounds. Conclusions: Color appearance depends not just on the mean color of the surround, but also on the distribution of surround colors about the mean. This novel form of simultaneous color contrast is inconsistent with a variety of models of color appearance, including those based on sensitivity regulation at the receptor level, and those in which the effects of complex surrounds on color appearance can be reduced to adaptation to the illuminant or induction from a homogeneous `equivalent surround'. It tends to normalize the gamut of perceived colors in each visual scene and may also contribute to color constancy under viewing conditions that affect contrast.},

The influences of this novel opsin are widespread, ranging from pupillary and circadian responses to brightness perception, yet established approaches to quantifying the biological effects of light do not adequately account for melanopsin sensitivity. We have recently proposed a novel metric, the melanopic sensitivity function (V Z {$\lambda$}), to address this deficiency. Here, we further validate this new measure with a variety of tests based on potential barriers to its applicability identified in the literature or relating to obvious practical benefits. Using electrophysiogical approaches and pupillometry, initially in rodless+coneless mice, our data demonstrate that under a very wide range of different conditions (including switching between stimuli with highly divergent spectral content) the V Z {$\lambda$} function provides an accurate prediction of the sensitivity of melanopsin-dependent responses. We further show that V Z {$\lambda$} provides the best available description of the spectral sensitivity of at least one aspect of the visual response in mice with functional rods and cones: tonic firing activity in the lateral geniculate nuclei. Together, these data establish V Z {$\lambda$} as an important new approach for light measurement with widespread practical utility.},

  abstract = {Photoreception in the mammalian retina is not restricted to rods and cones but extends to a small number of intrinsically photoreceptive retinal ganglion cells (ipRGCs), expressing the photopigment melanopsin [ 1\textendash 4 ]. ipRGCs are known to support various accessory visual functions including circadian photoentrainment and pupillary reflexes. However, despite anatomical and physiological evidence that they contribute to the thalamocortical visual projection [ 5\textendash 7 ], no~aspect of visual discrimination has been shown to rely upon ipRGCs. Based on their currently known roles, we~hypothesized that ipRGCs may contribute to distinguishing brightness. This percept is related to an object's luminance\textemdash a photometric measure of light intensity relevant for cone photoreceptors. However, the perceived brightness of different sources is not always predicted by their respective luminance [ 8\textendash 12 ]. Here, we used parallel behavioral and electrophysiological experiments to first show that melanopsin contributes to brightness discrimination in both retinally degenerate and fully sighted mice. We~continued to use comparable paradigms in psychophysical experiments to provide evidence for a similar role in healthy~human subjects. These data represent the first direct evidence that an aspect of visual discrimination in normally sighted subjects can be supported by inner retinal photoreceptors.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: To determine the light sensitivity of poorly reflective cones observed in retinas of normal subjects, and to establish a relationship between cone reflectivity and perceptual threshold. METHODS: Five subjects (four male, one female) with normal vision were imaged longitudinally (7-26 imaging sessions, representing 82-896 days) using adaptive optics scanning laser ophthalmoscopy (AOSLO) to monitor cone reflectance. Ten cones with unusually low reflectivity, as well as 10 normally reflective cones serving as controls, were targeted for perceptual testing. Cone-sized stimuli were delivered to the targeted cones and luminance increment thresholds were quantified. Thresholds were measured three to five times per session for each cone in the 10 pairs, all located 2.2 to 3.3\textdegree{} from the center of gaze. RESULTS: Compared with other cones in the same retinal area, three of 10 monitored dark cones were persistently poorly reflective, while seven occasionally manifested normal reflectance. Tested psychophysically, all 10 dark cones had thresholds comparable with those from normally reflecting cones measured concurrently (P = 0.49). The variation observed in dark cone thresholds also matched the wide variation seen in a large population (n = 56 cone pairs, six subjects) of normal cones; in the latter, no correlation was found between cone reflectivity and threshold (P = 0.0502). CONCLUSIONS: Low cone reflectance cannot be used as a reliable indicator of cone sensitivity to light in normal retinas. To improve assessment of early retinal pathology, other diagnostic criteria should be employed along with imaging and cone-based microperimetry.},

The basic hypothesis is that the estimate of the illuminant is made on the basis of spatial information from the entire visual field. This estimate is then used by the visual system to arrive at an estimate of the (object) reflectance of the various subfields in the complex visual scene. The estimates are made by matching the inputs to the system to linear combinations of fixed bases and standards in the colour space.

Traditionally, the way in which time is perceived, represented and estimated has been explained using a pacemaker\textendash accumulator model that is not only straightforward, but also surprisingly powerful in explaining behavioural and biological data. However, recent advances have challenged this traditional view. It is now proposed that the brain represents time in a distributed manner and tells the time by detecting the coincidental activation of different neural populations.},

  abstract = {The scientific community generally agrees on the theory, introduced by Riemann and furthered by Helmholtz and Schr\"odinger, that perceived color space is not Euclidean but rather, a three-dimensional Riemannian space. We show that the principle of diminishing returns applies to human color perception. This means that large color differences cannot be derived by adding a series of small steps, and therefore, perceptual color space cannot be described by a Riemannian geometry. This finding is inconsistent with the current approaches to modeling perceptual color space. Therefore, the assumed shape of color space requires a paradigm shift. Consequences of this apply to color metrics that are currently used in image and video processing, color mapping, and the paint and textile industries. These metrics are valid only for small differences. Rethinking them outside of a Riemannian setting could provide a path to extending them to large differences. This finding further hints at the existence of a second-order Weber\textendash Fechner law describing perceived differences.},

In relation to this topic, we built a spectral LED-based tuneable light source for the reconstruction of CIE standard illuminants. This light source consists of 31 spectral channels from 400nm to 700nm, an integrating cube and a control board with 16 bit resolution. Moreover, a minimization routine was developed to calculate the weighting values per channel for reproducing standard illuminants. The differences in colorimetric and fitting parameters between standard spectra and the theoretical and experimental ones, showed that the reconstructed spectra were very similar to the standard ones, specially for the D65 and A illuminants. However, there was a certain mismatching from 500nm to 600nm due to the lack of LEDs in this region. In conclusion, the developed LED-based light source and minimization routine are able to reproduce CIE standard illuminants with high accuracy.},

There is a clear philosophy, a sound criterion based in information theory, and a rigorous statistical foundation for AIC. AIC can be justified as Bayesian using a ``savvy'' prior on models that is a function of sample size and the number of model parameters. Furthermore, BIC can be derived as a non-Bayesian result. Therefore, arguments about using AIC versus BIC for model selection cannot be from a Bayes versus frequentist perspective. The philosophical context of what is assumed about reality, approximating models, and the intent of model-based inference should determine whether AIC or BIC is used. Various facets of such multimodel inference are presented here, particularly methods of model averaging.},

  abstract = {A color appearance model (CAM) is an advanced colorimetric tool used to predict color appearance under a wide variety of viewing conditions. A chromatic adaptation transform (CAT) is an integral part of a CAM. Its role is to predict "corresponding colors," that is, a pair of colors that have the same color appearance when viewed under different illuminants, after partial or full adaptation to each illuminant. Modern CATs perform well when applied to a limited range of illuminant pairs and a limited range of source (test) colors. However, they can fail if operated outside these ranges. For imaging applications, it is important to have a CAT that can operate on any real color and illuminant pair without failure. This paper proposes a new CAT that does not operate on the standard von Kries model of adaptation. Instead it relies on spectral reconstruction and how these reconstructions behave with respect to different illuminants. It is demonstrated that the proposed CAT is immune to some of the limitations of existing CATs (such as producing colors with negative tristimulus values). The proposed CAT does not use established empirical corresponding-color datasets to optimize performance, as most modern CATs do, yet it performs as well as or better than the most recent CATs when tested against the corresponding-color datasets. This increase in robustness comes at the expense of additional complexity and computational effort. If robustness is of prime importance, then the proposed method may be justifiable.},

  abstract = {We report a novel class of V4 neuron in the macaque monkey that responds selectively to equiluminant colored form. These "equiluminance" cells stand apart because they violate the well established trend throughout the visual system that responses are minimal at low luminance contrast and grow and saturate as contrast increases. Equiluminance cells, which compose {$\sim$}22\% of V4, exhibit the opposite behavior: responses are greatest near zero contrast and decrease as contrast increases. While equiluminance cells respond preferentially to equiluminant colored stimuli, strong hue tuning is not their distinguishing feature-some equiluminance cells do exhibit strong unimodal hue tuning, but many show little or no tuning for hue. We find that equiluminance cells are color and shape selective to a degree comparable with other classes of V4 cells with more conventional contrast response functions. Those more conventional cells respond equally well to achromatic luminance and equiluminant color stimuli, analogous to color luminance cells described in V1. The existence of equiluminance cells, which have not been reported in V1 or V2, suggests that chromatically defined boundaries and shapes are given special status in V4 and raises the possibility that form at equiluminance and form at higher contrasts are processed in separate channels in V4.},

  abstract = {Neurons in primate cortical area V4 are sensitive to the form and color of visual stimuli. To determine whether form selectivity remains consistent across colors, we studied the responses of single V4 neurons in awake monkeys to a set of two-dimensional shapes presented in two different colors. For each neuron, we chose two colors that were visually distinct and that evoked reliable and different responses. Across neurons, the correlation coefficient between responses in the two colors ranged from -0.03 to 0.93 (median 0.54). Neurons with highly consistent shape responses, i.e., high correlation coefficients, showed greater dispersion in their responses to the different shapes, i.e., greater shape selectivity, and also tended to have less eccentric receptive field locations; among shape-selective neurons, shape consistency ranged from 0.16 to 0.93 (median 0.63). Consistency of shape responses was independent of the physical difference between the stimulus colors used and the strength of neuronal color tuning. Finally, we found that our measurement of shape response consistency was strongly influenced by the number of stimulus repeats: consistency estimates based on fewer than 10 repeats were substantially underestimated. In conclusion, our results suggest that neurons that are likely to contribute to shape perception and discrimination exhibit shape responses that are largely consistent across colors, facilitating the use of simpler algorithms for decoding shape information from V4 neuronal populations.},

  abstract = {Despite great efforts over several decades, our best models of primary visual cortex (V1) still predict neural responses quite poorly when probed with natural stimuli, highlighting our limited understanding of the nonlinear computations in V1. At the same time, recent advances in machine learning have shown that deep neural networks can learn highly nonlinear functions for visual information processing. Two approaches based on deep learning have recently been successfully applied to neural data: transfer learning for predicting neural activity in higher areas of the primate ventral stream and data-driven models to predict retina and V1 neural activity of mice. However, so far there exists no comparison between the two approaches and neither of them has been used to model the early primate visual system. Here, we test the ability of both approaches to predict neural responses to natural images in V1 of awake monkeys. We found that both deep learning approaches outperformed classical linear- nonlinear and wavelet-based feature representations building on existing V1 encoding theories. On our dataset, transfer learning and data-driven models performed similarly, while the data-driven model employed a much simpler architecture. Thus, multi-layer CNNs set the new state of the art for predicting neural responses to natural images in primate V1. Having such good predictive in-silico models opens the door for quantitative studies of yet unknown nonlinear computations in V1 without being limited by the available experimental time.},

  abstract = {Conservation-based restrictions on light levels and cumulative exposure in museum galleries are now well established. These have resulted in restrictions on the use of daylight and prolonged development of systems to deliver and control its admittance. Attempts to control daylight and deliver fixed illuminance levels have proved difficult to sustain. Recent installations, in the 1980s and 1990s, have become reliant on a proportion of electric lighting during most opening hours and an acceptance of limited daylight variability within dosage recommendations. Given the difficulties in estimating and measuring dosage, most museums have limited data on their actual lighting performance, and guidance is sparse on how such targets can be met. This paper reviews the limited goals widely referred to in guidance to designers and presents typical data drawn from monitoring in the Frick Collection, New York. The balance between electric light and daylight is discussed in the context of an interior's daylit sensibility, and this provides the basis for a proposed widening of criteria for lighting performance in museum galleries.},

In this study, we investigated how rod mediated changes in color perception varied as a function of the magnitude of the rod contrast. Rod-mediated changes in color appearance were assessed by matching them with cone-mediated color changes. A two-channel four-primary colorimeter allowed independent control of the rods and each of the L-, M- and S-cone photoreceptor types. At all light levels, rod contributions to inferred PC, KC and MC pathway mediated vision were linearly related to the rod incremental contrast. This linear relationship could be described by a model based on primate ganglion cell responses with the assumption that rod signals were conveyed via rod\textendash cone gap junctions at mesopic light levels.},

At the photoreceptor level, we examine the cone excitation and the cone contrast spaces. We discuss the second-stage spaces, usually known as ATD- spaces, paying particular attention to Boynton's space and including a nonlinear space, the opponent modulation space. In addition, we approach third-stage transformations, which might take place at the cortical level. Finally, we analyse a perceptual ATD-type space, discussing how it might be derived as a third-stage transformation of an LGN-based ATD-space. R\'esum\'e.

  abstract = {In Museum Skepticism, art historian David Carrier traces the birth, evolution, and decline of the public art museum as an institution meant to spark democratic debate and discussion. Carrier contends that since the inception of the public art museum during the French Revolution, its development has depended on growth: on the expansion of collections, particularly to include works representing non-European cultures, and on the proliferation of art museums around the globe. Arguing that this expansionist project has peaked, he asserts that art museums must now find new ways of making high art relevant to contemporary lives. Ideas and inspiration may be found, he suggests, in mass entertainment such as popular music and movies.Carrier illuminates the public role of art museums by describing the ways they influence how art is seen: through their architecture, their collections, the narratives they offer museum visitors. He insists that an understanding of the art museum must take into account the roles of collectors, curators, and museum architects. Toward that end, he offers a series of case studies, showing how particular museums and their collections evolved. Among those who figure prominently are Baron Dominique Vivant Denon, the first director of the Louvre; Bernard Berenson, whose connoisseurship helped Isabella Stewart Gardner found her museum in Boston; Ernest Fenollosa, who assembled much of the Asian art collection now in the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston; Albert Barnes, the distinguished collector of modernist painting; and Richard Meier, architect of the J. Paul Getty Center in Los Angeles. Carrier's learned consideration of what the art museum is and has been provides the basis for understanding the radical transformation of its public role now under way.},

  abstract = {Primate color vision is based on two to three cone types in the retina, each expressing a different class of visual pigment, making them the only mammals that possess trichromacy. These pigment classes are the short wavelength-sensitive (SWS1) pigment and the long wavelength-sensitive (LWS) pigment, orthologues of the same pigments found in many other vertebrates, as well as the middle wavelength-sensitive (MWS) pigment, a paralogue to the LWS pigment. Trichromacy was achieved differently in Old World and New World primates. In Old World primates, a duplication of the LWS opsin gene occurred giving rise to a ``red-sensitive'' or L pigment and a ``green-sensitive'' or M pigment. Their corresponding L and M genes are adjacent on the X chromosome which, together with their high sequence homology, is the underlying cause for the high frequency of red-green color blindness seen in humans. In New World primates and prosimians, however, the mechanism leading to trichromacy, with one exception, is based on a single polymorphic LWS gene, from which different allelic variants encode pigments with differing spectral peaks. X chromosome inactivation limits expression to just one gene per photoreceptor meaning that trichromacy is only seen in females; while all male are red-green color blind. Despite several leading hypothesis, the reasons for the different evolutionary paths taken by Old and New World primates for trichromacy are still unclear and remain to be confirmed.},

  abstract = {Disorders of color vision can occur from retinal and cortical disorders. The most frequent abnormality in color perception (dyschromatopsia) is seen in color blindness because of photoreceptor genetic disorders. This chapter discusses the abnormalities in color perception because of the central nervous system lesions (acquired central achromatopsia or dyschromatopsia). Acquired central dyschromatopsia has been reported in disorders of the optic nerve and chiasma or in cerebral lesions (acquired cerebral achromatopsia). Cerebral achromatopsia has been reported limited to one hemifield (hemiachromatopsia) or involving all spared visual fields. The most frequent acquired central dyschromatopsia (ACD) is because of the optic neuritis, with desaturation in color appearance, abnormalities in the Ishihara plate test and other discrimination tests. In a prospective study on optic neuritis, Celesia et al. found that during the acute phase of the disease, all patients had abnormalities on color vision as tested with L'Anthony new color test. Recovery of vision varied for different visual functions. This differential recovery may reflect the patchy recovery of the optic nerve fibers and the persistence of isolated nerve fiber pathology, and is consistent with the concept of independent channels within the visual pathways. Other pathology affecting the optic nerve or the chiasma may produce ACD..},

The steps in both algorithms are described in detail. Like previous inversion algorithms, it relies on interpolations between entries in the 1943 table. For colours near the MacAdam limits, the inversion also requires extrapolations beyond the 1943 entries. The outputs of the current implementation do not differ significantly from the outputs of other inversion algorithms. The main distinguishing feature of the current algorithm is that both the algorithm and code implementation are publicly available. \textcopyright{} 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Col Res Appl, 2011;},

Protection of light sensitive exhibits from damaging effect of light while maintaining the higher exhibition quality with respect to visibility is a key concern in lighting design of art galleries. The conflict between light level for visibility of exhibition from viewers' perspective and conservation of artifacts creates philosophical dilemma for lighting design in art galleries. So, a review of literature has been done in this regard as this conflict still exists. The existing recommended light level for the art galleries from the view of conservation and the need for verification of this existing light level for better visibility have been discussed. As a consequence, this review of literature will help to find out the need of further research so that balance between visibility and conservation of light sensitive art exhibits can be done properly by lighting design of art galleries.},

We demonstrate that it is possible to design light sources that can provide both good colour rendering and high luminous efficacy by combining the outputs of a number of narrowband spectral constituents. Also, the achievable results depend on the numbers and wavelengths of the different spectral bands utilized in the mixture. Practical realization of these concepts has been demonstrated in this pilot study which combines a number of simulations with tests using real LEDs (light emitting diodes). Such sources are capable of providing highly efficient lighting systems with good energy conservation potential. Further research is underway to investigate the practicalities of our proposals in relation to large-scale light source production.},

These phones are equipped with high-end processors, high-resolution cameras, and built-in sensors such as accelerometer, orientation-sensor, and light-sensor. According to comScore survey, 26.2\% of U.S. adults use smart phones in their daily lives. Motivated by this statistic and the diverse capability of smart phones, we focus on utilizing them for biomedical applications. We present a new application of the smart phone with its built-in camera and microphone replacing the traditional stethoscope and cuff-based measurement technique, to quantify vital signs such as heart rate and blood pressure. We propose two differential blood pressure estimating techniques using the heartbeat and pulse data. The first method uses two smart phones whereas the second method replaces one of the phones with a customized external microphone. We estimate the systolic and diastolic pressure in the two techniques by computing the pulse pressure and the stroke volume from the data recorded. By comparing the estimated blood pressure values with those measured using a commercial blood pressure meter, we obtained encouraging results of 95-100\% accuracy.},

Among the documented causes of the persistent lack of diversity in STEM are bias, discrimination, and harassment of members of underrepresented minority groups (URMs). These issues persist due to continued marginalization, power imbalances, and lack of adequate policies against misconduct in academic and other scientific institutions. All scientists can play important roles in reversing this trend by shifting the culture of academic workplaces to intentionally implement equitable and inclusive policies, set norms for acceptable workplace conduct, and provide opportunities for mentorship and networking. As scientists are increasingly acknowledging the lack of racial and ethnic diversity in science, there is a need for clear direction on how to take antiracist action. Here we present 10 rules to help labs develop antiracists policies and action in an effort to promote racial and ethnic diversity, equity, and inclusion in science.},

  abstract = {The smoothness of reflectance spectra allows them to be represented by linear models using a small number of parameters. The question of how many parameters are required has been extensively studied by many researchers in the last couple of decades. In this thesis, this question has been thoroughly addressed by applying linear models to different spectral data sets. It was found the performance of a linear model is highly data-set dependent. Different classes of linear models have also been investigated and compared according to the purpose of minimising perceptual differences, and applied to spectral images as a means of spectral compression. A proposed method for efficient representation of spectral images was found to perform better than previous methods. The performance of linear models based on a criterion of an averaged CIELAB {$\Delta$}E*ab of 1 unit has been commonly used for the evaluation of uniform colours. However, a larger tolerance is required for the evaluation of complex images. The performance of linear models of spectral images have been psychophysically studied; the results indicated that the number of basis functions required is also related to image content from which the spectra are derived. Furthermore, a psychophysical study was carried to investigate the effect of spatial structure and complexity changes on the perceptual tolerance of linear-model representations of Mondrian spectral images. It was found the perceptual tolerance do vary with the spatial complexity of the spectral images. Statistical analysis and Fourier-frequency analysis were carried on several sets of natural and man-made reflectance spectra derived from hyperspectral images. It was found that most reflectance spectra are low-pass and are smooth functions of wavelength. A physical model was then proposed and developed using modified Gaussian functions to represent absorption properties of surfaces. Reflectance spectra can be fitted with the physical model with the intention of minimising both spectral and colorimetric reconstruction errors. Though more parameters are required for physical models when compared to conventional linear models, all modelled reflectance spectra are constrained to be in the physical range. A set of artificial spectral reflectance generated from the physical model showed better performance than Munsell spectra in terms of representing natural and man-made reflectance spectra.},

A key task is to answer how many basis functions of a linear model are necessary for a given accuracy of representation. While the most common application is the reproduction of color and images, which highly relate to human perception, it is important to understand the relationship between human perceptual tolerance of spectral images and the number of basis functions of the corresponding linear models. In this study several data sets and psychophysical studies have been used to address the question of how many basis functions are necessary to represent a spectral image so that it is indistinguishable from the original (complete) representation. The results show that the number of basis function required is highly image dependent: 3 to 8 basis functions needed for different types of images.},

We also find that marriage improves well-being for both younger and older cohorts, whereas cohabitation benefits only the younger cohort. Our main contribution to the literature is on well-being effects of same-sex partnerships. We find that these effects are homogeneous to sexual orientation. Gender differences exist in the well-being effects of same-sex partnerships: females are happier cohabiting, whereas marriage has a stronger well-being effect on males.},

Specifically, the impact of light levels on trip hazard detection during walking has received relatively little attention. This study investigates the effect of illuminance on people's ability to detect steps of different heights in a laboratory-based controlled environment. Sixteen young and 15 older participants walked along a 13.2\,m walkway towards an either ascending or descending step at 200 lux or 4 lux light levels. Trial time, gaze behaviour and distance at which the step was first visually fixated (detection distance) were measured using an eye-tracker. It was found that both the trial time and detection distance of older participants were affected by light level whereas the fixation number and fixation duration of young participants were affected by step-height. Shorter detection distance, greater number of fixations and longer fixation duration were found among older participants as opposed to young participants. The results suggest that the processing efficiency for visual information on an upcoming step is slower among older people than among young people. This implies that the vulnerability of older pedestrians maybe be reduced if better lighting or a simplified visual environment is provided.},

Natural illuminant spectra of 238 samples measured in temperate forests were characterized by principal-component analysis. The spectra can be accurately approximated by the mean and the first two principal components. Compared with illumination under open skies, the loci of forest illuminants are displaced toward the green region in the chromaticity plots, and unlike open sky illumination they cannot be characterized by correlated color temperature. We show that it is possible to recover illuminant spectra accurately from digital video images by a linear least-squares-fit estimation technique. The use of digital video data in spectral analysis provides a promising new approach to the studies of the spatial and temporal variation of illumination in natural scenes and the understanding of color vision in natural environments.},

Second, adaptation-the visual system's adjustment to background light \textendash{} affected achromatic decrements more than increments. Third, the regulation of adaptation for incremental and decremental stimuli depended differently on background signals from the three cone types.

These measurements revealed the shapes of the boundaries that separate opponent colors in three-dimensional color space. Opponent color classification boundaries were generally not planar, but their shapes could be summarized by a piecewise linear model in which increment and decrement color signals are combined with different weights at two stages to produce opponent color sensations. The effect of background light on classification was largely explained by separate gain changes in increment and decrement cone signals.},

We found this idea interesting but not thoroughly tested. In particular, tests on real images were limited to scenes made up artificially from hyperspectral data,4 spectral power distributions of various daylight illuminants, and the human cone sensitivity functions. The Ruderman database4 of hyperspectral images is also quite peculiar because it consists of a small number of images of mostly foliage. Our experiments show that for scenes composed from a more diversified hyperspectral database combined with real illuminant spectra, the predicted correlation turns out to be very weak. For actual digital camera images, the luminance-redness correlation fails completely.},

Many of these analyses could not have been done before simply because a large database for color constancy was not available. Our image database consists of approximately 11,000 images in which the RGB color of the ambient illuminant in each scene is measured. To build such a large database we used a novel set-up consisting of a digital video camera with a neutral gray sphere attached to the camera so that the sphere always appears in the field of view. Using a gray sphere instead of the standard gray card facilitates measurement of the variation in illumination as a function of incident angle. The study focuses on the analysis of the distribution of various illuminants in the natural scenes and the correlation between the rg-chromaticity of colors recorded by the camera and the rg-chromaticity of the ambient illuminant. We also investigate the possibility of improving the performance of the na\"ive Gray World algorithm by considering a sequence of consecutive frames instead of a single image. The set of images is publicly available and can also be used as a database for testing color constancy algorithms.},

During this early heating phase, the interface between the two immiscible liquids was found to form a surface of rotation with a conic cross section that acted as a mirror to produce an excellent image of the filament of the bulb within the lower liquid. The relevant features of the lamp construction are discussed briefly, and photographs of this focusing effect are shown. A simple analysis is presented that transforms the photographed cross section of the liquid interface into the true cross section by removing the effect of the cylindrical lens formed by the fluid-filled bottle, and the resulting cross section is then fitted to the shape of an ellipse. The possible cause for the shape of this liquid interface is discussed and compared and contrasted with the somewhat analogous situation of a stretched circular membrane that is subjected to different gas pressures on either side of the membrane.},

A visual oddball task was employed where frequent and infrequent colored stimuli were either same- or different-category, with chromatic differences equated across conditions. Stimuli were presented peripheral to a central distractor task to elicit an event-related potential (ERP) known as the visual mismatch negativity (vMMN). The vMMN is an index of automatic and pre-attentive visual change detection arising from generating loci in visual cortices. The results revealed a greater vMMN for different-category than same-category change detection when stimuli appeared in the lower visual field, and an absence of attention-related ERP components. The findings provide the first clear evidence for an automatic and pre-attentive categorical code for color.},

Infants were shown frequent presentations of one color (standard) interspersed with infrequent presentations of a color that was either from the same category (within-category deviant) or from a different category (between-category deviant) to the standard. Differences in the event-related potentials elicited by the stimuli were found that were related to the categorical relationship of the standard and the deviant stimuli.

The present paper discusses procedures for accomplishing the decomposition or resolution of any visual stimulus into these components. These methods rest on the fact that the color-stimulus space is a space of three dimensions and the metameric black space is orthogonal to it. Introduced and given specific attention here is the particular procedure wherein the stimulus-energy vector is premultiplied by A(A{${'}$} A)-1A{${'}$}, A being any matrix of experimentally established color-mixture data with three linearly independent columns (primaries). This computation provides the fundamental metamer (as we shall call it) of the visual stimulus being analyzed. The difference between the stimulus-energy distribution and the fundamental metameric function provides the metameric black function. Examples of both types of functions are given and discussed.},

  abstract = {Sensory prostheses can restore aspects of natural sensation by delivering electrical current directly into sensory circuits. An effective sensory prosthetic should be capable of generating reliable real-time perceptual signals for hours each day over many years. However, we still know little regarding the stability of percepts produced by electrical microstimulation of cerebral sensory cortex when stimulation is delivered repeatedly over long periods. Developing methods that yield highly sensitive and reliable assessments of a subject's sensitivity to stimulation is important for developing prosthetic devices that can mimic the constant stream of information inherent in daily experience. Here, we trained rhesus monkeys to report electrical microstimulation of their primary visual cortex (V1) and measured how repeated stimulation affected the minimal electrical current needed to generate a percept (behavioral detection threshold). Using adaptive staircase procedures with a two-alternative forced-choice (2AFC) detection task, we obtained highly reliable detection threshold measures with as few as 100 trials. Using either chronically implanted or acutely inserted microelectrodes, we found that repeated electrical microstimulation elevated detection thresholds, with effects persisting between daily testing sessions. Our results demonstrate task designs that can support rapid and reliable measurements of detection thresholds, and point to the need for validation that detection thresholds in targeted structures will be sufficiently stable in the face of the amount of chronic stimulation that will be required for effective sensory prosthetics.},

The past several years have seen important scientific and technical advances that are changing our understanding of these mechanisms.

  abstract = {The contribution that different brain areas make to primate color vision, especially in the macaque, is debated. Here we used functional magnetic resonance imaging in the alert macaque, giving a whole brain perspective of color processing in the healthy brain. We identified color-biased and luminance-biased activity and color-afterimage activity. Color-biased activity was found in V1, V2, and parts of V4 and not in V3a, MT, or other dorsal stream areas, in which a luminance bias predominated. Color-biased activity and color-afterimage activity were also found in a region on the posterior bank of the superior temporal sulcus. We review anatomical and physiological studies that describe this region, PITd, and postulate that it is distinct from areas V4 and TEO. When taken together with single-unit studies and lesion studies, our results suggest that color depends on a connected ventral-stream pathway involving at least V1, V2, V4, and PITd.},

  abstract = {Explanations for color phenomena are often sought in the retina, lateral geniculate nucleus, and V1, yet it is becoming increasingly clear that a complete account will take us further along the visual-processing pathway. Working out which areas are involved is not trivial. Responses to S-cone activation are often assumed to indicate that an area or neuron is involved in color perception. However, work tracing S-cone signals into extrastriate cortex has challenged this assumption: S-cone responses have been found in brain regions, such as the middle temporal (MT) motion area, not thought to play a major role in color perception. Here, we review the processing of S-cone signals across cortex and present original data on S-cone responses measured with fMRI in alert macaque, focusing on one area in which S-cone signals seem likely to contribute to color (V4/posterior inferior temporal cortex) and on one area in which S signals are unlikely to play a role in color (MT). We advance a hypothesis that the S-cone signals in color-computing areas are required to achieve a balanced neural representation of perceptual color space, whereas those in noncolor-areas provide a cue to illumination (not luminance) and confer sensitivity to the chromatic contrast generated by natural daylight (shadows, illuminated by ambient sky, surrounded by direct sunlight). This sensitivity would facilitate the extraction of shape-from-shadow signals to benefit global scene analysis and motion perception.},

  abstract = {Languages vary in their number of color terms. A widely accepted theory proposes that languages evolve, acquiring color terms in a stereotyped sequence. This theory, by Berlin and Kay (BK), is supported by analyzing best exemplars (``focal colors'') of basic color terms in the World Color Survey (WCS) of 110 languages. But the instructions of the WCS were complex and the color chips confounded hue and saturation, which likely impacted focal-color selection. In addition, it is now known that even so-called early-stage languages nonetheless have a complete representation of color distributed across the population. These facts undermine the BK theory. Here we revisit the evolution of color terms using original color-naming data obtained with simple instructions in Tsimane', an Amazonian culture that has limited contact with industrialized society. We also collected data in Bolivian-Spanish speakers and English speakers. We discovered that information theory analysis of color-naming data was not influenced by color-chip saturation, which motivated a new analysis of the WCS data. Embedded within a universal pattern in which warm colors (reds, oranges) are always communicated more efficiently than cool colors (blues, greens), as languages increase in overall communicative efficiency about color, some colors undergo greater increases in communication efficiency compared to others. Communication efficiency increases first for yellow, then brown, then purple. The present analyses and results provide a new framework for understanding the evolution of color terms: what varies among cultures is not whether colors are seen differently, but the extent to which color is useful.},

  abstract = {Inferior temporal cortex (IT) is a key part of the ventral visual pathway implicated in object, face, and scene perception. But how does IT work? Here, I describe an organizational scheme that marries form and function and provides a framework for future research. The scheme consists of a series of stages arranged along the posterior-anterior axis of IT, defined by anatomical connections and functional responses. Each stage comprises a complement of subregions that have a systematic spatial relationship. The organization of each stage is governed by an eccentricity template, and corresponding eccentricity representations across stages are interconnected. Foveal representations take on a role in high-acuity object vision (including face recognition); intermediate representations compute other aspects of object vision such as behavioral valence (using color and surface cues); and peripheral representations encode information about scenes. This multistage, parallelprocessing model invokes an innately determined organization refined by visual experience that is consistent with principles of cortical development. The model is also consistent with principles of evolution, which suggest that visual cortex expanded through replication of retinotopic areas. Finally, the model predicts that the most extensively studied network within IT\textemdash the face patches\textemdash is not unique but rather one manifestation of a canonical set of operations that reveal general principles of how IT works.},

  abstract = {The spatial structure of color cell receptive fields is controversial. Here, spots of light that selectively modulate one class of cones (L, M, or S, or loosely red, green, or blue) were flashed in and around the receptive fields of V-1 color cells to map the spatial structure of the cone inputs. The maps generated using these cone-isolating stimuli and an eye-position-corrected reverse correlation technique produced four findings. First, the receptive fields were Double-Opponent, an organization of spatial and chromatic opponency critical for color constancy and color contrast. Optimally stimulating both center and surround subregions with adjacent red and green spots excited the cells more than stimulating a single subregion. Second, red\textendash green cells responded in a luminance-invariant way. For example, red-on-center cells were excited equally by a stimulus that increased L-cone activity (appearing bright red) and by a stimulus that decreased M-cone activity (appearing dark red). This implies that the opponency between L and M is balanced and argues that these cells are encoding a single chromatic axis. Third, most color cells responded to stimuli of all orientations and had circularly symmetric receptive fields. Some cells, however, showed a coarse orientation preference. This was reflected in the receptive fields as oriented Double-Opponent subregions. Fourth, red\textendash green cells often responded to S-cone stimuli. Responses to M- and S-cone stimuli usually aligned, suggesting that these cells might be red\textendash cyan. In summary, red\textendash green (or red\textendash cyan) cells, along with blue\textendash yellow and black\textendash white cells, establish three chromatic axes that are sufficient to describe all of color space.},

  abstract = {Neurons in the lateral geniculate nucleus cannot perform the spatial color calculations necessary for color contrast and color constancy. Under neutral-adapting conditions, we mapped the cone inputs (L, M, and S) to 83 cone-opponent cells representing the central visual field of the next stage of visual processing, primary visual cortex (V1), to determine how the color signals are spatially transformed. Cone-opponent cells, constituting {$\sim$}10\% of V1 cells, formed two populations, red\textendash green (L vs M; 66 of 83) and blue\textendash yellow (S vs L+M; 17 of 83). Many cone-opponent cells (48 of 83) were double-opponent, with circular receptive-field centers and crescent-shaped surrounds (0.63\textdegree{} offset) that had opposite chromatic tuning to the centers and a time-to-peak 11 ms later than the centers. The remaining cone-opponent cells were either spatially opponent in only one cone system (20 of 83) or lacked spatial opponency (15 of 83). Cells lacking spatial opponency had smaller receptive fields (0.5\textendash 0.7\textdegree ) than spatial-opponent cell centers ({$\sim$}1\textdegree ). We found that red\textendash green cells received S-cone input, which aligned with M input, and, unlike blue\textendash yellow cells, red\textendash green cells gave push\textendash pull responses: receptive-field centers of red-ON cells were excited by both L increments (bright red) and M decrements (dark red) and were suppressed by both L decrements (dark green) and M increments (bright green). Excitatory responses to decrements were slightly larger than to increments, which may account for the lower detection and discrimination thresholds of decrements shown psychophysically. By virtue of their specialized receptive fields, the neurons described here spatially transform the cone signals and represent the first stage in the visual system at which spatially opponent color calculations are made.},

Here we address the neural basis for color, using targeted single-unit recording in alert macaque monkeys, guided by functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) of the same subjects. Distributed within posterior inferior temporal cortex, a large region encompassing V4, PITd, and posterior TEO that some have proposed functions as a single visual complex, we found color-biased fMRI hotspots that we call ``globs,'' each several millimeters wide. Almost all cells located in globs showed strong luminance-invariant color tuning and some shape selectivity. Cells in different globs represented distinct visual field locations, consistent with the coarse retinotopy of this brain region. Cells in ``interglob'' regions were not color tuned, but were more strongly shape selective. Neither population was direction selective. These results suggest that color perception is mediated by specialized neurons that are clustered within the extrastriate brain.},

  abstract = {Background The perception of brightness depends on spatial context: the same stimulus can appear light or dark depending on what surrounds it. A less well-known but equally important contextual phenomenon is that the colour of a stimulus can also alter its brightness. Specifically, stimuli that are more saturated (i.e. purer in colour) appear brighter than stimuli that are less saturated at the same luminance. Similarly, stimuli that are red or blue appear brighter than equiluminant yellow and green stimuli. This non-linear relationship between stimulus intensity and brightness, called the Helmholtz-Kohlrausch (HK) effect, was first described in the nineteenth century but has never been explained. Here, we take advantage of the relative simplicity of this `illusion' to explain it and contextual effects more generally, by using a simple Bayesian ideal observer model of the human visual ecology. We also use fMRI brain scans to identify the neural correlates of brightness without changing the spatial context of the stimulus, which has complicated the interpretation of related fMRI studies. Results Rather than modelling human vision directly, we use a Bayesian ideal observer to model human visual ecology. We show that the HK effect is a result of encoding the non-linear statistical relationship between retinal images and natural scenes that would have been experienced by the human visual system in the past. We further show that the complexity of this relationship is due to the response functions of the cone photoreceptors, which themselves are thought to represent an efficient solution to encoding the statistics of images. Finally, we show that the locus of the response to the relationship between images and scenes lies in the primary visual cortex (V1), if not earlier in the visual system, since the brightness of colours (as opposed to their luminance) accords with activity in V1 as measured with fMRI. Conclusions The data suggest that perceptions of brightness represent a robust visual response to the likely sources of stimuli, as determined, in this instance, by the known statistical relationship between scenes and their retinal responses. While the responses of the early visual system (receptors in this case) may represent specifically the statistics of images, post receptor responses are more likely represent the statistical relationship between images and scenes. A corollary of this suggestion is that the visual cortex is adapted to relate the retinal image to behaviour given the statistics of its past interactions with the sources of retinal images: the visual cortex is adapted to the signals it receives from the eyes, and not directly to the world beyond.},

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$>$}Genome wide association studies have provided evidence for a significant association between {$<$}em{$>$}ZNF804A{$<$}/em{$>$} (zinc finger protein 804A) - specifically the intronic single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs1344706 - and schizophrenia, but little is known about the function of the gene or the effects of the SNP. By studying post-mortem human brain tissue, I characterised ZNF804A immunoreactivity in adult and foetal human brain and investigated effects of diagnosis and rs1344706 genotype on ZNF804A mRNA and protein expression. Secondly, I looked in a large sample of healthy volunteers (n=922) at the effects of rs1344706 on brain structure using volumetry and voxel based morphometry (VBM). Furthermore, I recruited healthy volunteers who were either homozygous for the risk allele or homozygous for the non-risk allele (n=50). They participated in magnetoencephalography (MEG) and magnetic resonance (MR) sessions in which brain activity was measured during a working memory task, a visual processing task, and rest. Using magnetic resonance spectroscopy, also neurotransmitter levels were assessed. The experiments conducted for this thesis showed for the first time that ZNF804A immunoreactivity can be detected in both foetal and adult human brain and that it is mainly localised to layer III pyramidal cells, with a granular subcellular distribution throughout the cytoplasm. No effect of rs1344706 on mRNA and protein expression was found. In our structural MRI study, rs1344706 did not affect macroscopic brain structure as measured by volumetry and VBM, and given the large sample size, this seems a convincing negative. However, we did find that rs1344706 alters prefrontal-hippocampal connectivity, with increased connectivity being observed in risk homozygotes. Additionally, using MEG, we found an effect of {$<$}em{$>$}ZNF804A{$<$}/em{$>$} genotype on hippocampal connectivity in the theta band (4-8Hz), with non-risk homozygotes displaying more connectivity. This finding provides a first clue as to the mechanisms that might underlie the previously observed effects of rs1344706 on prefrontal-hippocampal connectivity. Future studies will need to elucidate the actual function of the ZNF804A protein, in order to bridge the gap between the molecular and neuroimaging findings described in this thesis.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

Existing quantitative studies show that, by this definition, human subjects show poor colour constancy. A different and complementary aspect of colour constancy is considered which is concerned with the ability of a subject to attribute correctly changes in the colour appearance of a scene either to changes in reflecting properties of the surfaces that make up the scene, or to changes in the spectral composition of the illuminant. Data are presented showing that, if the changes in the appearance of a scene were sufficiently great, subjects were capable of making the required discriminations highly reliably, and without scrutiny.},

The spectral bands were contiguous, covering the whole visible spectrum, and their widths were chosen so that they had approximately equal weight from a color rendering point of view. All tolerances were measured in relation to a full radiator reference illuminant, for single bands and also for combinations of bands. With these results it is possible to predict the color rendering performance of an illuminant knowing only the relative energy distribution in its spectrum. Examples are given. In general, the computed performance agrees with practical judgments derived from ordinary use.},

The regularity of the rise of liminal test stimulus with decrease of the interval between it and the conditioning stimulus precludes any purely psychological expla\-nation, and the effect is presumed to be due to some nervous interaction in the higher centres of visual reception. The paper further records results of measurement of liminal test stimulus after exposure of the eye to conditioning stimuli of brief duration (recovery of dark adaptation) under a wide variety of conditions, including reversal of test field contrast, effect of superimposed steady background, effect of area of test field, use of equivalent background transformation, personal variation, effect of intensity of conditioning stimulus, effect of spatial and temporal pattern of conditioning stimulus, colour of conditioning stimulus, etc.},

  abstract = {The most versatile neurophysiological paradigms for the study of cognitive function in animals are those that involve recording the activity of neurons in awake and behaving monkeys. Techniques for recording in behaving monkeys were originally developed by Herbert Jaspers and colleagues (Jasper et al., 1960) and elaborated by Edward Evarts (Evarts, 1966; Evarts, 1968) in the 1960s. Conventional recording methods, based on these early developments, employ single movable sharp electrodes to isolate single cells in regions of interest. Cells must be recorded serially over many weeks to accumulate enough data to characterize the population of cells under study. More recently, systems that permit several sharp electrodes\textemdash from approximately 2 to 16\textemdash to be independently positioned have improved the yield and allow the activity of several cells to be monitored simultaneously. Recordings of this kind, however, are generally restricted to a single cortical or subcortical site and can be maintained only for a short time. In this chapter, we will describe a range of contemporary and emerging methods for studying the activity of large numbers of neurons, in multiple cortical and subcortical locations, for periods extending from several weeks to several years. Techniques for conducting multielectrode recordings will be described with special emphasis on issues unique to conducting these experiments in behaving monkeys (readers interested in more detail will be directed to the more specialized chapters of this volume and other resources where appropriate). To demonstrate the value of these methods for addressing significant neuroscientific questions, an example of the use of multi-electrode recordings in behaving monkeys from our own work will be described.},

Such cases have the potential to provide useful information regarding the loci of the generation of the percept of color. One available tool to examine this issue is the chromatic visual evoked potential (cVEP). The cVEP has been used successfully to objectively quantify losses in color vision capacity in both congenital and acquired deficiencies of retinal origin but has not yet been applied to cases of color losses of cortical origin. In addition, it is not known with certainty which cortical sites are responsible for the generation of the cVEP waveform components. Here we report psychophysical and electrophysiological examination of a patient with color deficits resulting from a bilateral cerebral infarct in the ventral occipitotemporal region. Although this patient demonstrated pronounced color losses of a general nature, the waveform of the cVEP remains unaffected. Contrast response functions of the cVEP are also normal for this patient. The results suggest that the percept of color arises after the origin of the cVEP and that normal activity in those areas that give rise to the characteristic negative wave of the cVEP are not sufficient to provide for the normal sensation of color.},

Notably, in both tasks, each observer was free to decide whether two pairs of colors were the same or belonged to the same category. The use of the same stimulus set for both tasks provides, we argue, an incremental behavioural measure of colour processing from detection through discrimination to categorisation. The measured data spaces are different for the two tasks, and furthermore the categorisation data is unique to each observer. In addition, we develop a model which assumes that the principal difference between the tasks is the degree of similarity between the stimuli which has different constraints for the categorisation task compared to the discrimination task. This approach not only makes sense of the current (and associated) data but links the processes of discrimination and categorisation in a novel way and, by implication, expands upon the previous research linking categorisation to other tasks not limited to colour perception.},

  abstract = {An earlier paper has described a new method to optimise the spectral power distribution of solid state lighting systems used in museums. This paper will discuss the question of the selection of the test samples used for the spectral power distribution optimisation for the illumination of renaissance paintings. For fine tuning the spectrum the help of museum curators was needed, who remember the appearance of the pictures under traditional light sources and who were able to advise lighting engineers to tune the spectrum to obtain a pleasing appearance. The paper will show the results obtained by testing the optimum spectrum in the museum. Part 1 of the present publication dealt with a new method to optimise the spectral power distribution of Solid State Lighting systems used in museums. Part 2 will discuss the question of test samples for the illumination of renaissance paintings and will show results obtained by testing the optimum spectrum in the museum.},

  abstract = {This is the first book to introduce the new statistics - effect sizes, confidence intervals, and meta-analysis - in an accessible way. It is chock full of practical examples and tips on how to analyze and report research results using these techniques. The book is invaluable to readers interested in meeting the new APA Publication Manual guidelines by adopting the new statistics - which are more informative than null hypothesis significance testing, and becoming widely used in many disciplines. Accompanying the book is the Exploratory Software for Confidence Intervals (ESCI) package, free software that runs under Excel and is accessible at www.thenewstatistics.com. The book's exercises use ESCI's simulations, which are highly visual and interactive, to engage users and encourage exploration. Working with the simulations strengthens understanding of key statistical ideas. There are also many examples, and detailed guidance to show readers how to analyze their own data using the new statistics, and practical strategies for interpreting the results. A particular strength of the book is its explanation of meta-analysis, using simple diagrams and examples. Understanding meta-analysis is increasingly important, even at undergraduate levels, because medicine, psychology and many other disciplines now use meta-analysis to assemble the evidence needed for evidence-based practice. The book's pedagogical program, built on cognitive science principles, reinforces learning: Boxes provide "evidence-based" advice on the most effective statistical techniques. Numerous examples reinforce learning, and show that many disciplines are using the new statistics. Graphs are tied in with ESCI to make important concepts vividly clear and memorable. Opening overviews and end of chapter take-home messages summarize key points. Exercises encourage exploration, deep understanding, and practical applications. This highly accessible book is intended as the core text for any course that emphasizes the new statistics, or as a supplementary text for graduate and/or advanced undergraduate courses in statistics and research methods in departments of psychology, education, human development , nursing, and natural, social, and life sciences. Researchers and practitioners interested in understanding the new statistics, and future published research, will also appreciate this book. A basic familiarity with introductory statistics is assumed.},

A fourcategory classification of materials according to sensitivity to visible light is proposed, together with a basis for relating the classifications to ISO blue-wool categories. Limiting illuminances and annual exposures for visible light are proposed, and two classes of UV control are recommended. All of these concepts are drawn together into a recommended practical procedure that covers setting up and maintaining museum lighting. The paper summarises these proposals and explains their technical basis.},

The basic physical processes are defined, and the effects of ultraviolet (uv), luminous flux and infrared (IR) exposure on object degradation are examined. Recent research is reviewed, and new data on wavelength dependency of fading lead to some reassessment of attitudes based on earlier data. The aim for lighting and conservation of museum objects is defined as satisfying viewers with the least possible amount of energy being absorbed by the displayed object. Current standards and recommended practices are reviewed, and it is concluded that museum lighting policies should be directed towards control of non-visible irradiance, both IR and uv, and that future research should move beyond examining fading effects of exposure to studying ways to satisfy viewers with minimum absorbed energy.},

  abstract = {Display lighting which enhances object appearance may be legitimate for many museum exhibits, but is generally inappropriate for works of art. These require presentation which reveals their intrinsic visible characteristics with accuracy and honesty, and the term 'exhibition' is used to distinguish this process from display. It requires that the entire setting, including lighting, develops from an aim to reveal works of art rather than to enhance them, and the notion of 'the well-lit room' is promoted as a concept which expresses the essentials of this design approach. However, it is evident that these may conflict with recommended illuminance maxima, particularly the 50 lux level for more sensitive objects. A working model of the photochemical processes is proposed to give an improved basis for specifying control of lighting. Limiting values of annual damage exposure are derived from the current illuminance maxima recommendations; these permit a more flexible approach to reconciling competing requirements for exhibition and conservation. Also, the model provides a framework which enables information relating to exposure of materials and to means for controlling degradation to be evaluated in terms which can readily be related to actual conditions of exhibition m museums and art galleries.},

  abstract = {Many types of museum exhibits are susceptible to damage caused by exposure to light, and current recommendations for museum lighting include avoidance of nonvisible radiant power (UV and IR), limitation of illumination level, and restriction of exposure duration. However, these recommendations do not distinguish between the potential of incident radiant power in the visible spectrum to stimulate the sense of brightness (illuminance) and its potential to cause damage (irradiance).This article investigates the notion that the visual satisfaction provided by incandescent sources could be matched with significantly less irradiance by illumination composed of three spectral bands corresponding to red, green, and blue light. Pairs of identical artworks were displayed in two adjacent simulated art galleries, and 16 subjects adjusted the illumination in the test gallery to match the appearance of the similar display in the comparison gallery. The light source in the comparison gallery was an MR tungsten halogen display spotlight of either low (2850 K) or intermediate (4200 K) color temperature. The light source in the test gallery was either an identical MR spotlight, or it was an experimental three-band source of far lesser irradiance for which the color temperature had been matched to that in the comparison gallery.It was found that, when instructed to adjust for equality of appearance, the subjects set for equality of illuminance. For this condition, the irradiance of the artworks was significantly less for the three-band source than for either of the MR lamps. Also, at equal illuminance and color temperatures, subjects' responses indicated that they were conscious of differences in appearance between the three-band source and the MR lamps, but the difference seemed slight and they did not necessarily discriminate against the three-band source. It is concluded that a practical light source for museums could be developed that would have the potential to equal the visual satisfaction provided by incandescent lamps at a given illuminance, while exposing exhibits to significantly less irradiance, thus reducing their rate of degradation while on display.},

  abstract = {Human vision starts with the activation of rod photoreceptors in dim light and short (S)-, medium (M)-, and long (L)- wavelength-sensitive cone photoreceptors in daylight. Recently a parallel, non-rod, non-cone photoreceptive pathway, arising from a population of retinal ganglion cells, was discovered in nocturnal rodents. These ganglion cells express the putative photopigment melanopsin and by signalling gross changes in light intensity serve the subconscious, 'non-image-forming' functions of circadian photoentrainment and pupil constriction. Here we show an anatomically distinct population of 'giant', melanopsin-expressing ganglion cells in the primate retina that, in addition to being intrinsically photosensitive, are strongly activated by rods and cones, and display a rare, S-Off, (L + M)-On type of colour-opponent receptive field. The intrinsic, rod and (L + M) cone-derived light responses combine in these giant cells to signal irradiance over the full dynamic range of human vision. In accordance with cone-based colour opponency, the giant cells project to the lateral geniculate nucleus, the thalamic relay to primary visual cortex. Thus, in the diurnal trichromatic primate, 'non-image-forming' and conventional 'image-forming' retinal pathways are merged, and the melanopsin-based signal might contribute to conscious visual perception.},

However, the influence of cortico-cortical feedback on awareness and the nature of the feedback effects are not yet completely understood. In the present study, we used electrical microstimulation in the visual cortex of monkeys to test the hypothesis that cortico-cortical feedback plays a role in visual awareness. We investigated the interactions between the primary visual cortex (V1) and area V4 by applying microstimulation in both cortical areas at various delays. We report that the monkeys detected the phosphenes produced by V1 microstimulation but subthreshold V4 microstimulation did not influence V1 phosphene detection thresholds. A second experiment examined the influence of V4 microstimulation on the monkeys' ability to detect the dimming of one of three peripheral visual stimuli. Again, microstimulation of a group of V4 neurons failed to modulate the monkeys' perception of a stimulus in their receptive field. We conclude that conditions exist where microstimulation of area V4 has only a limited influence on visual perception.},

  abstract = {To investigate the performance of three different colour fidelity metrics, Commission Internationale de l'Eclairage (CIE) colour-rendering index (CRI), colour quality scale (CQS) and CRI2012, lighting booth experiments were conducted. Three different light-emitting diode spectral power distribution, all at correlated colour temperatures of 2800 K, 4000 K and 6500 K, were simulated for Ra {$>$} 90, Ra {$\approx$} 80 and Ra {$<$} 60. It was found that CIE CRI, CQS and CRI2012 were highly correlated with visual colour difference. It was also found that colour quality scale provides better prediction for the light-emitting diode light source that highly increases object chroma. However, more colour fidelity experiments using light-emitting diode light sources that highly increase object chroma are required before recommending any final colour fidelity metric.},

  abstract = {We measured chromatic discrimination under conditions where the target fields could be distinguished only by the ratio of excitation of the long- (L) and middle-wavelength (M) cones. The excitation level of the short-wavelength (S) cones was varied in the experiments, although for any given measurement the S-cone excitation was common to the two target fields and could not be directly used for discrimination. Adaptation was maintained by a steady neutral background metameric to Illuminant D65. Thresholds varied substantially and systematically with the S-cone level of the target probes, but in a complex way: when the ratio of L:M cone excitation was low, an increase in S-cone excitation reduced the thresholds, but when the L:M ratio was higher, an increase in S-cone excitation raised the thresholds. To account for the pattern of results, we postulate a neural channel that draws synergistic inputs from L and S cones and an opposed input from M cones. The proposed channel has a compressive response function and is most sensitive at the point set by the steady background.},

Is discrimination enhanced at the boundaries between perceptual hues, in the way that discrimination may be enhanced at the boundaries between speech sounds in hearing? In the chromaticity diagram, the locus of unique green separates colours that appear yellowish from those that appear bluish. Using a two-alternative spatial forced choice and an adapting field equivalent to the Daylight Illuminant D65, we measured chromatic discrimination along lines orthogonal to the locus of unique green. In experimental runs interleaved with these performance measurements, we obtained estimates of the phenomenological boundary from the same observers. No enhancement of objectively measured discrimination was observed at the category boundary between yellowish and bluish hues. Instead, thresholds were minimal at chromaticities where the ratio of long-wave to middle-wave cone excitation was the same as that for the background adapting field.},

  abstract = {The precision of human colour discrimination depends on the region of colour space in which measurements are made and on the direction in which the compared colours\textemdash the discriminanda\textemdash differ. Working in a MacLeod\textendash Boynton chromaticity diagram scaled so that thresholds at the white point were equal for the two axes, we made measurements at reference points lying on lines that passed at 45\textdegree{} or -45\textdegree{} through the white point. At a given reference chromaticity, we measured thresholds either for saturation (i.e. for discriminanda lying radially along the line passing through the white point) or for hue (i.e. for discriminanda lying on a tangent of a circle passing through the reference point and centred on the white point). The discriminanda always straddled the reference point in chromaticity. The attraction of this arrangement is that the two thresholds can be expressed in common units. All that differs between saturation and hue measurements is the phase with which the short-wave signal is combined with the long-/middle-wave signal. Except for chromaticities very close to the white point, saturation thresholds were systematically higher than hue thresholds. We offer a possible explanation in terms of correlated neural noise.},

  abstract = {To examine the potential contribution of first-stage photoreceptor adaptation to color constancy, photon catches from 337 natural objects illuminated with phases of daylight and tungsten light were calculated for a model human fovea. The rank ordering of these photon catches within each cone photoreceptor class was examined. When first-stage adaptation is modeled using multiplicative or subtractive mechanisms, or a monotonic nonlinearity, no reordering of the rank ordering of photon catches is possible across illuminant changes. The observed rank orderings remained nearly invariant across illuminant changes for all three photoreceptor classes, although there was some local shifting in the rank orderings, thus ruling out the ability of von Kries adaptation alone to produce perfect color constancy. This means that for objects with natural reflectance spectra, the ordinal relationships between the photon catches within a class of photoreceptors exhibit only minor changes for these illuminant shifts. This result may be attributable to the fact that approx. 95\% of the variance in these reflectance spectra is captured by the first principal component; objects that produce relatively few absorptions under one phase of daylight illumination will also produce relatively few absorptions under another phase. A geometric formalism for understanding these relationships is presented, and limitations on this analysis are discussed.},

The present study explored category effects in children's colour search. The relationship between linguistic colour categories and perceptual categories was addressed by comparing native speakers of languages differing in the number of colour terms. Experiment 1 compared English and Kwanyama (Namibian) children aged 4 to 7 years on a visual search task, using target-distractor pairs (blue-green, blue-purple, red-pink) for which the Kwanyama did not have distinct names. The presence of a category advantage in the English, but not in the Kwanyama, suggested that linguistic boundaries may affect search performance. Experiment 2 examined visual search performance in the green-yellow and the blue-green region, in English and Himba (Namibian) 6-year-olds. The number of distractors was varied to assess search efficiency. Cross-category search was more efficient than within-category search in the English group, but this advantage was absent in the Himba. Increasing the number of distractors affected search speed in the English group, but not in the Himba. Overall, these findings suggest cross-language differences in categorical effects on colour search, but also in the way the children performed the search. The nature of the category effect in search is discussed with respect to these findings.},

  abstract = {Color rendering refers to a light source's ability to make the colors of illuminated objects appear natural or accurate. The color rendering index (CRI) is currently the only internationally-standardized way to assess a light source's color rendering abilities. The CRI has shortcomings in application, however, and its problems are pronounced when applied to newer lighting technologies, such as light-emitting diodes (LEDs). Since the introduction of the CRI to the present day, alternative methods have been proposed and studied. Some methods are based on the shape of the spectral output of the source, considering broadband sources to have better color rendering than sources with spectral peaks or valleys. Several proposals share the basic method of CRI, with modifications to improve performance. Still other ideas are based on measures of the gamut area of rendered object colors. The International Commission on Illumination (CIE) is in the process of developing and recommending a new metric of color rendition.},

  abstract = {The color rendering index (CRI) has been shown to have deficiencies when applied to white light-emitting-diode\textendash based sources. Furthermore, evidence suggests that the restricted scope of the CRI unnecessarily penalizes some light sources with desirable color qualities. To solve the problems of the CRI and include other dimensions of color quality, the color quality scale (CQS) has been developed. Although the CQS uses many of elements of the CRI, there are a number of fundamental differences. Like the CRI, the CQS is a test-samples method that compares the appearance of a set of reflective samples when illuminated by the test lamp to their appearance under a reference illuminant. The CQS uses a larger set of reflective samples, all of high chroma, and combines the color differences of the samples with a root mean square. Additionally, the CQS does not penalize light sources for causing increases in the chroma of object colors but does penalize sources with smaller rendered color gamut areas. The scale of the CQS is converted to span 0\textendash 100, and the uniform object color space and chromatic adaptation transform used in the calculations are updated. Supplementary scales have also been developed for expert users.},

  abstract = {A direct projection from melanopsin-expressing intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells (ipRGCs) reaches the primary visual thalamus (dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus; dLGN). The significance of this melanopsin input to the visual system is only recently being investigated. One unresolved question is the degree to which neurons in the dLGN could use melanopsin to track dynamic changes in light intensity under light adapted conditions. Here we set out to address this question. We were able to present full field steps visible only to melanopsin by switching between rod-isoluminant `yellow' and `blue' lights in a mouse lacking cone function (Cnga3 -/- ). In the retina these stimuli elicited melanopsin-like responses from a subset of ganglion cells. When presented to anaesthetised mice, we found that \textasciitilde 25-30\% of visually responsive neurones in the contralateral dLGN responded to these melanopsin-isolating steps with small increases in firing rate. Such responses could be elicited even with fairly modest increases in effective irradiance (32\% Michelson contrast for melanopsin). These melanopsin-driven responses were apparent at bright backgrounds (corresponding to twilight-daylight conditions), but their threshold irradiance was strongly dependent upon prior light exposure when stimuli were superimposed on a spectrally neutral ramping background light. While both onset and offset latencies were long for melanopsin-derived responses compared to those evoked by rods, there was great variability in these parameters with some cells responding to melanopsin steps in \&lt;1 s. These data indicate that a subset of dLGN units can employ melanopsin signals to detect modest changes in irradiance under photopic conditions.},

  abstract = {A new method was used to characterize computer-controlled liquid crystal displays (LCDs). The characterization, which was performed to enable colorimetric image display, included channel independence, spatial independence, screen uniformity, and colorimetry. The colorimetric model consisted of three one-dimensional look-up tables (LUTs) describing each channel's optoelectronic transfer function and a 3 \texttimes{} 4 matrix transformation that included black-level flare. The matrix coefficients were estimated statistically by minimizing the average CIEDE2000 color difference for a data set sampling the display's colorimetric gamut. The LUTs were recreated dynamically throughout the optimization of the matrix coefficients. The characterization was implemented with three different instruments to evaluate the robustness of the method with respect to measurement uncertainty. The average performance ranged between 0.1 and 0.4 {$\Delta$}E00 and was well correlated with instrument precision. The optimization approach improved performance by a factor of two compared with direct measurements. Despite differences in instrument design, the chromaticities of each primary following optimization and black-level flare compensation were very similar. This excellent performance was a result of the display's optoelectronic properties well matching the model assumptions. The technique was also used to characterize three additional LCD displays ranging in their matching of the model assumptions. In this case, performance worsened. For one display, more complex models would be required for colorimetric characterization. Finally, a colorimetric characterization based on measurements at the center of the display and perpendicular to the face was used to predict measurements at the edges and at different angles. The results indicated that characterizations would be required at multiple positions and angles in order to achieve sufficient accuracy. \textcopyright{} 2004 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

We used the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) and Horne and Ostberg's questionnaire to ascertain aspects of sleep quality and CT and Cambridge Colour Test (CCT) and the Lanthony Desaturated D-15 Test (D-15d) to verify the color perception. Significant difference was found in the PSQI (F(2.20) = 15.77, p p p p p p {$<$} .001). The chromatic confusion axes will vary according to the synchronization of daily variation and the EM typology has higher chromatic sensitivity, pointing to a possible relation between visual circadian filters and spatial chromatic information. The daily fluctuation of visual sensitivity may explain the preliminary results on the circadian effects on color perception. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)},

The light in each canopy level was assumed to consist of non-intercepted radiation and radiation intercepted within the level and transmitted. The spectrum of non-intercepted light in each canopy level is the same as that of incident light above the canopy (input parameter), whereas the spectrum of transmitted light depends on leaf area index (LAI) and the mean transmission spectrum of leaves. The model was tested in a forest and provided adequate predictions of measured values. Stronger deviations were produced in the near infrared (NIR) waveband in lower canopy levels. Multiple regression between LAI, as the dependent variable, and spectral characteristics (Blue, Green, Red and NIR intensities) had an r2 of 0.926. As a complement to other methods, I suggest light spectrum analysis as a non-destructive technique for estimating LAI in forest canopies.},

In this work, the colour fading of silk samples dyed with several natural dyes (containing flavonoids and anthraquinones) and exposed to three different white LEDs is considered. The fading at the end of the exposure experiment was evaluated by measuring the variations induced by the LEDs on the colour coordinates of the samples and by investigating the variation of the concentration of the dyes by high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with photo-diode array and mass spectrometric detectors. The information obtained gives an in-depth picture of the fading by considering the actual damage potential of LEDs on natural dyes, which is relevant for selecting the most suitable lamps for display cases.},

  abstract = {The optical density of the human crystalline lens progressively increases with age, the greatest increase in the visible spectrum being at short wavelengths. This produces a gradual shift in the spectral distribution of the light reaching the retina, yet color appearance remains relatively stable across the life span, implying that the visual system adapts to compensate for changes in spectral sensitivity. We explored properties of this adaptive renormalization by measuring changes in color appearance following cataract surgery. When the lens is removed, cataract patients often report a large perceptual shift in color appearance that can last for months. This change in color appearance was quantified for four cataract patients (63\textendash 84 years) by determining the chromaticity of stimuli that appeared achromatic before surgery, and at various intervals after surgery for up to 1 year. Stimuli were presented on a calibrated CRT as 9.5-deg spots, with 3-s duration and 3-s interstimulus intervals (ISIs). Chromaticity was adjusted by the subjects in CIE L*a*b* color space with luminance fixed at 32 cd/m2, on a dark background. We also estimated the optical density of the cataractous lens by comparing absolute scotopic thresholds from 410 nm to 600 nm before and after surgery. The results demonstrated that immediately following surgery there is a large increase in the short-wave light reaching the retina, mainly below 500 nm. The achromatic settings generally showed an initial large shift in the ``yellow'' direction after surgery that gradually (but never fully) returned to the original achromatic point before surgery. The shifts in the achromatic point occur over a number of months and appear to occur independently of the fellow eye.},

  abstract = {A strategy is reported to optimize lighting to reduce photochemical degradation of works of art and archival documents. The strategy revolves around improving luminous efficiency of the spectral profile to exclude light which doesn't contribute to brightness or color perception, while also trying to maintain color rendering. The work focuses on Old Master Drawings and designing filters for illuminants, but is applicable to the broad range of art and archival documents and the direct design of lighting without filters such as LED. A filter profile is identified which seems to be beneficial, or at worst neutral for all pigments measured. Underlying principles are identified: (1) The best luminous efficiencies arise from multiple band illuminants, and also improves as color rendering is sacrificed. (2) Protection of an object even late in its damage life can significantly extend its remaining life. (3) Protection of an object early in its life can possibly abate some of the light induced damage it may experience across its life, so early intervention in light protection may be advised. This report further goes on to suggest approaches to further enhance the protection, including tailoring the spectral dependence of appearance change. \textcopyright{} 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

  abstract = {The purpose of this research is to design the best lighting that will minimize long term photochemical degradation of Old Master Drawings and/or other works of art, while maintaining the patron's appreciation of the object's color and detail. The present approach is a technological refinement to the basic underlying earlier work on fluorescent lighting by W. A. Thornton, W.A. at General Electric1. Thin-film dielectric, multi-coating technology is used to create filters that eliminate ultraviolet light, near infrared light and significant unnecessary parts from the visible spectrum, thus maximizing the reduction in photochemical degradation, while maintaining optimal color rendering. Three interference filters, were designed and manufactured successfully. The filters are designated Mark 1, Mark 2, \& Mark 3. In this dissertation, the filters are analyzed with regard to their performance parameters. This includes color rendering, retardation in fading or color change, beam angle effects, filter stability, perceived brightness, and visual appreciation parameters. To a high confidence level, all three filters are perceived as being indistinguishable from Unfiltered light with regard to the color confusion index parameter (CCI). Subjective assessments by tests subjects suggest the Mark 3 filter may display some distinguishability with a confidence level for distinguishability of 35\% for the overall satisfaction parameter. The Mark 3 filter is the most complex three-color type spectral profile and this might be expected due to beam angle effects or departures in accuracy of color theory. Beam angle affects suggest that the Mark 1 and Mark 2 filters do not display significant color rendering aberrations due to Newton's colors interference effects, except possibly at the periphery of the broadest (55-60+\textdegree ) beam angle lamps. Filtered and Unfiltered light are effectively of the same perceived brightness, though to a low confidence level, Unfiltered light might be perceived brighter. Accelerated aging studies of the filters indicate useful mean time before failures of {$>$}20 years. In fact, no failure was observed in any of the accelerated studies, The Mark 2 and Mark 3 filters were evaluated in equal-luminosity studies with regard to their effect on limiting fading of both standard fading samples such as the ISO Blue Wool series, and also other commercial pigments or stains. Within experimental error, the Mark 2 filter either slowed fading or had no effect on fading for all pigments relative to Unfiltered light and Optivex\textregistered{} filtered light, Optivex\textregistered{} being a common commercial filter used to protect works of art. Mark 3 protected in many cases, but for some pigments it was less protective than Optivex\textregistered{} filtered light. This failure is interpreted in terms of the wavelength dependence of the excess light in certain wavelength regions on an equal luminosity condition, and suggests that more subtle wavelength dependent optimizations have to be undertaken for filters which possess significant band separation.},

  abstract = {This paper introduces a new technique for the analysis of the chromatic properties of neurones, and applies it to cells in the lateral geniculate nucleus (l.g.n.) of macaque. The method exploits the fact that for any cell that combines linearly the signals from cones there is a restricted set of lights to which it is equally sensitive, and whose members can be exchanged for one another without evoking a response. Stimuli are represented in a three-dimensional space defined by an axis along which only luminance varies, without change in chromaticity, a 'constant B' axis along which chromaticity varies without changing the excitation of blue-sensitive (B) cones, a 'constant R \& G' axis along which chromaticity varies without change in the excitation of red-sensitive (R) or green-sensitive (G) cones. The orthogonal axes intersect at a white point. The isoluminant plane defined by the intersection of the 'constant B' and 'constant R \& G' axes contains lights that vary only in chromaticity. In polar coordinates the constant B axis is assigned the azimuth 0-180 deg, and the constant R \& G axis the azimuth 90-270 deg. Luminance is expressed as elevation above or below the isoluminant plane (-90 to +90 deg). For any cell that combines cone signals linearly, there is one plane in this space, passing through the white point, that contains all lights that can be exchanged silently. The position of this 'null plane' provides the 'signature' of the cell, and is specified by its azimuth (the direction in which it intersects the isoluminant plane of the stimulus space) and its elevation (its angle of inclination to the isoluminant plane). A colour television receiver was used to produce sinusoidal gratings whose chromaticity and luminance could be modulated along any vector passing through the white point in the space described. The spatial and temporal frequencies of modulation could be varied over a large range. When stimulated by patterns of low spatial and low temporal frequency, two groups of cells in the parvocellular laminae of the l.g.n. were distinguished by the locations of their null planes. The null planes of the larger group were narrowly distributed about an azimuth of 92.6 deg and more broadly about an elevation of 51.5 deg, which suggests that they receive opposed, but not equally balanced, inputs from only R and G cones. These we call R-G cells.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)},

  abstract = {Working memory is crucial for short-term information processing, but its limited capacity means items are not represented with perfect fidelity to the external world. Many systematic patterns of error exist that are thought to be telling of the underlying mechanisms that process and maintain information in memory. Here we suggest that the processes governing some of these patterns of errors are interrelated and highly individual. Specifically, we look at how perceptual structure relates to stimulus-specific biases in color, and further explore the possible implication of this connection for contextual biases like serial dependence and repulsion between concurrently presented items. In Experiment 1, using a novel within-participant serial reproduction method, we reveal reliable attractors in color space across individuals, as well as individual differences that significantly influence these stimulus-specific biases. Simulations based on an independently measured perceptual structure of the stimulus space reproduce the group-level differences but do not capture the observed individual variation. In Experiment 2, we investigate how contextual biases \textendash{} serial dependence when remembering 1 item and inter-item repulsion when remembering 2 items \textendash{} interact with stimulus-specific biases. We identify color-specific properties of these contextual biases, suggesting they may depend on the stimulus-specific biases. We argue that because stimulus-specific biases are connected to perceptual structure, this same latent structure may impact the contextual biases. Overall, we show a strong connection between stimulus-specific biases, contextual biases, and perceptual structure, as well as rich individual differences in these biases.},

Third, the flashonly image is used to estimate object reflectance functions. Fourth, using the estimated reflectance functions, the ambient illumination spectral power distribution is estimated. We present results that evaluate the method's stability with respect to changes in the mean reflectance function of the scene.

As a first step toward testing whether light source spectrum choices\textemdash which are possible with light emitting diode (LED) systems\textemdash offer similar benefits, we examined preferences for various spectra in a scale model of an office. Participants judged the model's brightness, colorfulness, and pleasantness when lit with five preset spectra with measured correlated color temperatures (CCTs) of 2855, 3728, 4751, 5769, and 6507 K created with five LED channels and one fluorescent spectrum (3750 K measured), all at approximately 500 lx. Then they chose their preferred light spectrum using the five LED channels, once as a free choice and once with an illuminance limit. Judgments of the fluorescent spectrum and the LED spectrum with the closest (matched) CCT did not differ. The preset judgments followed a quadratic pattern, with the lowest and highest CCT conditions having lower ratings than the three middle conditions. The free and illuminance-constrained lighting choices did not differ, with individuals' selections ranging from 2850 to 14,000 K and generally lying slightly below the blackbody curve.},

  abstract = {This paper describes the development and application of a spectral imaging system based on the prism.grating.prism (PGP) line-scan concept. The system is validated against an integrating sphere spectrometer using 22 pigments. Measurements were made on several Old Master drawings and one nineteenth-century watercolour. Results are reported for a watercolour by Eugene Louis Lami to illustrate application of the system. For a square object, 23970 individual reflection spectra are captured in a single scan resulting in file sizes of typically 115 MB. Software has been created that permits direct access, by on-screen selection, to the reflection spectrum of any given pixel in an image, reconstructed from the reflection data. PGP-type spectral scanning systems offer the advantage of potentially very high spectral resolutions of {$<$}0.5 nm, though the implementation here is for 5 nm resolution. Digital resolution across a square object is 512 \texttimes{} {$\sim$}50 for a PGP slit width of 80 {$\mu$}m. Details of the basic device construction, calibration and operation are provided. The system described here was designed for relatively low spatial resolution, although higher resolution can be achieved with modifications suggested in this publication.},

  abstract = {Life on earth is subject to alternating cycles of day and night imposed by the rotation of the earth. Consequently, living things have evolved photodetective systems to synchronize their physiology and behavior with the external light-dark cycle. This form of photodetection is unlike the familiar ``image vision,'' in that the basic information is light or darkness over time, independent of spatial patterns. ``Nonimage'' vision is probably far more ancient than image vision and is widespread in living species. For mammals, it has long been assumed that the photoreceptors for nonimage vision are also the textbook rods and cones. However, recent years have witnessed the discovery of a small population of retinal ganglion cells in the mammalian eye that express a unique visual pigment called melanopsin. These ganglion cells are intrinsically photosensitive and drive a variety of nonimage visual functions. In addition to being photoreceptors themselves, they also constitute the major conduit for rod and cone signals to the brain for nonimage visual functions such as circadian photoentrainment and the pupillary light reflex. Here we review what is known about these novel mammalian photoreceptors.},

  abstract = {The human spectral luminosity function (V{$\lambda$}) can be modeled as the linear sum of signals from long-wavelength-selective (L) and middle-wavelength-selective (M) cones, with L cones being weighted by a factor of {$\sim$}2. This factor of {$\sim$}2 is thought to reflect an approximate 2:1 ratio of L:M cones in the human retina, which has been supported by studies that allow for more direct counting of different cone types in the retina. In contrast to humans, several lines of retinally based evidence in macaques suggest an L:M ratio closer to 1:1. To investigate the consequences of differences in L:M cone ratios between humans and macaques, red\textendash green equiluminance matches obtained psychophysically in humans (n=11) were compared with those obtained electrophysiologically from single neurons in the extrastriate middle temporal visual area of macaques (M. mulatta, n=5). Neurons in the middle temporal visual area were tested with sinusoidal red\textendash green moving gratings across a range of luminance contrasts, with equiluminance being defined as the red\textendash green contrast yielding a response minimum. Human subjects were tested under analogous conditions, by a minimally distinct motion technique, to establish psychophysical equiluminance. Although red\textendash green equiluminance points in both humans and macaques were found to vary across individuals, the means across species differed significantly; compared with humans, macaque equiluminance points reflected relatively greater sensitivity to green. By means of a simple model based on equating the weighted sum of L and M cone signals, the observed red\textendash green equiluminance points were found to be consistent with L:M cone ratios of approximately 2:1 in humans and 1:1 in macaques. These data thus support retinally based estimates of L:M cone ratios and further demonstrate that the information carried in the cone mosaic has functional consequences for red\textendash green spectral sensitivity revealed perceptually and in the dorsal stream of visual cortex.},

  abstract = {The spectrum of light reaching the eye from a surface depends not only on its reflectance properties but also on the chromaticity and spatial distribution of the illumination. Accurate estimation of surface properties, including color and material, is only possible if the visual system takes this dependence into account. A series of three studies examine whether the human visual system discounts the illumination in three-dimensional environments when estimating the color of matte surfaces. Specifically, behavioral experiments were conducted to address the following questions: (1) Do observers systematically discount secondary illumination originating from nearby chromatic objects when estimating surface color? (2) What is the effect of perceived orientation on the perceived color of matte surfaces in rendered three-dimensional scenes illuminated by a blue diffuse light and a yellow punctate light? (3) Which part of the spatial frequency spectrum of the illumination is utilized by the visual system when estimating the color of matte surfaces? In each study, a parametric model based on the physics of light-surface interactions of matte surfaces (as they would occur in the respective experiment-specific 3D environment) was derived and fit to observers' data. The model allowed for errors in observers' estimates of the chromaticities of the light sources and/or their spatial distribution (equivalent illuminant model). The results, taken together, indicate that in three-dimensional scenes, the visual system's estimate of surface color is affected by its interpretation of the geometric layout of the scene; the visual system effectively estimates how light flows within a scene as part of normal visual processing; and, the visual system's spatial resolution of the illumination is well matched to the task it is performing.},

The resolution of the maps is 10 min of visual angle, nearly an order of magnitude finer than previous maps. No striate receptive field center was found more than 5 min into the ipsilateral visual field. The four maps were sufficiently compatible with one another that they could be combined into one. There are only minor magnification differences between the right and left hemispheres and between the upper and lower quadrants. There is a vertical/horizontal magnification anisotropy of about 1.5:1 in central foveal cortex (0 to 20 min).

However, more recently, the topic has been examined using the empirical framework of crossmodal correspondences research. The field remains one in which consistent results and generalisable hypotheses about the existence and nature of colour\textendash shape correspondences are lacking. The replicability and consistency of findings concerning colour\textendash shape correspondences are examined in three online colour\textendash shape matching experiments using the same procedure and study design while varying the sets of shape stimuli that are evaluated. Participants matched one of 36 colours to each shape as well as made preference and arousal appraisal ratings for each of the shapes and colours. The complexities of analysing colour\textendash shape correspondence data are discussed and illustrated by classifying and analysing shape and colours in a variety of different ways, including using continuous perceptual and objective measures. Significant colour\textendash shape associations were found. However, as hypothesised, limited consistent results in regard to what perceptual shape characteristics predicted colour choices were documented across the three stimuli sets. This was the case both within and across different analysis methods. The factors that may be responsible for these inconsistencies are critically discussed. Intriguingly, however, evidence for emotional mediation, whereby shape and colour liking and arousal appraisals appear to influence the colour\textendash shape correspondences made by participants, was found across all three experiments.},

  abstract = {In primate vision, the encoding of color perception arises from three types of retinal cone cells (L, M, and S cones). The inputs from these cones are linearly integrated into two cone-opponent channels (cardinal axes) before the lateral geniculate nucleus. In subsequent visual cortical stages, color-preferring neurons cluster into functional domains within ``blobs'' in V1, ``thin/color stripes'' in V2, and ``color bands'' in V4. Here, we hypothesize that, with increasing cortical hierarchy, the functional organization of hue representation becomes more balanced and less dependent on cone opponency. To address this question, we used intrinsic signal optical imaging in macaque V1, V2, and V4 cortices to examine the domain-based representation of specific hues (here referred to as ``hue domains'') in cone-opponent color space (4 cardinal and 4 intermediate hues). Interestingly, we found that in V1, the relative size of S-cone hue preference domain was significantly smaller than that for other hues. This notable difference was less prominent in V2, and, in V4 was virtually absent, resulting in a more balanced representation of hues. In V2, hue clusters contained sequences of shifting preference, while in V4 the organization of hue clusters was more complex. Pattern classification analysis of these hue maps showed that accuracy of hue classification improved from V1 to V2 to V4. These results suggest that hue representation by domains in the early cortical hierarchy reflects a transformation away from cone-opponency and toward a full-coverage representation of hue.},

  abstract = {Trichromacy in all Old World primates is dependent on separate X-linked MW and LW opsin genes that are organized into a head-to-tail tandem array flanked on the upstream side by a locus control region (LCR). The 5{${'}$} regions of these two genes show homology for only the first 236 bp, although within this region, the differences are conserved in humans, chimpanzees, and two species of cercopithecoid monkeys. In contrast, most New World primates have only a single polymorphic X-linked opsin gene; all males are dichromats and trichromacy is achieved only in those females that possess a different form of this gene on each X chromosome. By sequencing the upstream region of this gene in a New World monkey, the marmoset, we have been able to demonstrate the presence of an LCR in an equivalent position to that in Old World primates. Moreover, the marmoset sequence shows extensive homology from the coding region to the LCR with the upstream sequence of the human LW gene, a distance of {$>$}3 kb, whereas homology with the human MW gene is again limited to the first 236 bp, indicating that the divergent MW sequence identifies the site of insertion of the duplicated gene. This is further supported by the presence of an incomplete Alu element on the upstream side of this insertion point in the MW gene of both humans and a cercopithecoid monkey, with additional Alu elements present further upstream. Therefore, these Aluelements may have been involved in the initial gene duplication and may also be responsible for the high frequency of gene loss and gene duplication within the opsin gene array. Full trichromacy is present in one species of New World monkey, the howler monkey, in which separate MW and LW genes are again present. In contrast to the separate genes in humans, however, the upstream sequences of the two howler genes show homology with the marmoset for at least 600 bp, which is well beyond the point of divergence of the human MW and LW genes, and each sequence is associated with a different LCR, indicating that the duplication in the howler monkey involved the entire upstream region.

  abstract = {A key principle of retinal organization is that distinct ON and OFF channels are relayed by separate populations of bipolar cells to different sublaminae of the inner plexiform layer (IPL). ON bipolar cell axons have been thought to synapse exclusively in the inner IPL (the ON sublamina) onto dendrites of ON-type amacrine and ganglion cells. However, M1 melanopsin-expressing ganglion cells and dopaminergic amacrine (DA) cells apparently violate this dogma. Both are driven by ON bipolar cells, but their dendrites stratify in the outermost IPL, within the OFF sublamina. Here, in the mouse retina, we show that some ON cone bipolar cells make ribbon synapses in the outermost OFF sublayer, where they costratify with and contact the dendrites of M1 and DA cells. Whole-cell recording and dye filling in retinal slices indicate that type 6 ON cone bipolars provide some of this ectopic ON channel input. Imaging studies in dissociated bipolar cells show that these ectopic ribbon synapses are capable of vesicular release. There is thus an accessory ON sublayer in the outer IPL. J. Comp.

  abstract = {Light is used to illuminate objects in the built environment. Humans can only observe light reflected from an object. Light absorbed by an object turns into heat and does not contribute to visibility. Since the spectral output of the new lighting technologies can be tuned, it is possible to imagine a lighting system that detects the colours of objects and emits customised light to minimise the absorbed energy. Previous optimisation studies investigated the use of narrowband LEDs to maximise the efficiency and colour quality of a light source. While these studies aimed to tune a white light source for general use, the lighting system proposed here minimises the energy consumed by lighting by detecting colours of objects and emitting customised light onto each coloured part of the object. This thesis investigates the feasibility of absorption-minimising light source spectra and their impact on the colour appearance of objects and energy consumption.   Two computational studies were undertaken to form the theoretical basis of the absorption-minimising light source spectra. Computational simulations show that the theoretical single-peak spectra can lower the energy consumption up to around 38 \% to 62 \%, and double-peak test spectra can result in energy savings up to 71 \%, without causing colour shifts. In these studies, standard reference illuminants, theoretical test spectra and coloured test samples were used. These studies are followed by the empirical evidence collected from two psychophysical experiments. Data from the experiments show that observers find the colour appearance of objects equally natural and attractive under spectrally optimised spectra and reference white light sources. An increased colour difference, to a certain extent, is found acceptable, which allows even higher energy savings. However, the translucent nature of some objects may negatively affect the results.},

The book is a selection of extended versions of the best papers presented at the Sixth IEEE International Workshop on Intelligent Data Acquisition and Advanced Computing Systems: Technology and Applications IDAACS 2011 related to this topic and encompass applications that go from multidimensional imaging to evoked potential detection in brain computer interfaces. The objective was to provide a broad spectrum of measurement applications so that the different techniques and approaches could be presented. Digital Image and Signal Processing for Measurement Systems concentrates on signal processing for measurement systems and its objective is to provide a general overview of the area and an appropriate introduction to the topics considered. This is achieved through 10 chapters devoted to current topics of research addressed by different research groups within this area. These 10 chapters reflect advances corresponding to signals of different dimensionality. They go from mostly one dimensional signals in what would be the most traditional area of signal processing realm to RGB signals and to signals of very high dimensionality such as hyperspectral signals that can go up to dimensionalities of more than one thousand. The chapters have been thought out to provide an easy to follow introduction to the topics that are addressed, including the most relevant references, so that anyone interested in this field can get started in the area. They provide an overview of some of the problems in the area of signal and image processing for measurement systems and the approaches and techniques that relevant research groups within this area are employing to try to solve them which, in many instances are the state of the art of some of these topics.},

  abstract = {What role does color play in the neural representation of complex shapes? We approached the question by measuring color responses of face-selective neurons, using fMRI-guided microelectrode recording of the middle and anterior face patches of inferior temporal cortex (IT) in rhesus macaques. Face-selective cells responded weakly to pure color (equiluminant) photographs of faces. But many of the cells nonetheless showed a bias for warm colors when assessed using images that preserved the luminance contrast relationships of the original photographs. This bias was also found for non-face-selective neurons. Fourier analysis uncovered two components: the first harmonic, accounting for most of the tuning, was biased toward reddish colors, corresponding to the L{$>$}M pole of the L-M cardinal axis. The second harmonic showed a bias for modulation between blue and yellow colors axis, corresponding to the S-cone axis. To test what role face-selective cells play in behavior, we related the information content of the neural population with the distribution of face colors. The analyses show that face-selective cells are not optimally tuned to discriminate face colors, but are consistent with the idea that face-selective cells contribute selectively to processing the green-red contrast of faces. The research supports the hypothesis that color-specific information related to the discrimination of objects, including faces, is handled by neural circuits that are independent of shape-selective cortex, as captured by the multistage parallel processing framework of IT (Lafer-Sousa and Conway, 2013).},

How the bee visual system manages this task is of interest for understanding information processing in miniaturized systems, as well as the relationship between bee pollinators and flowering plants. Bees can quickly discriminate dissimilar colours, but can also slowly learn to discriminate very similar colours, raising the question as to how the visual system can support this, or whether it is simply a learning and memory operation. We discuss the detailed neuroanatomical layout of the brain, identify probable brain areas for colour processing, and suggest that there may be multiple systems in the bee brain that mediate either coarse or fine colour discrimination ability in a manner dependent upon individual experience. These multiple colour pathways have been identified along both functional and anatomical lines in the bee brain, providing us with some insights into how the brain may operate to support complex colour discrimination behaviours.},

  abstract = {We present a color-constancy algorithm that uses quantum-catch data from reflected lights to recover surface reflectance functions and illuminant spectral power distributions. The algorithm recovers both surface and light-source spectral properties simultaneously. The method works in all situations that were handled by the earlier two-stage algorithms of Maloney and Wandell [ J. Opt. Soc. Am. A3, 29 ( 1986)] and D'Zmura and Iverson [ J. Opt. Soc. Am. A9, 490 ( 1992); J. Opt. Soc. Am. A10, 2148, 2166 ( 1993); J. Opt. Soc. Am. A11, 1970 ( 1994)]. In addition, the method handles problems that lie outside the scope of earlier algorithms. Using this method, a trichromatic visual system can recover, when provided adequate information, spectral descriptions of arbitrarily high accuracy for lights and surfaces. We determine conditions under which bilinear models can be used to recover color properties uniquely with the new procedure, and we formulate an algorithm for checking whether a particular bilinear model provides perfect color constancy. This research extends our analysis of linear methods for color constancy begun earlier [ J. Opt. Soc. Am. A10, 2148, 2166 ( 1993)].},

  abstract = {A human observer is able to recognize the color of objects irrespective of the light used to illuminate them. This is called color constancy. A digital camera uses a sensor to measure the reflected light, meaning that the measured color at each pixel varies according to the color of the illuminant. Therefore, the resulting colors may not be the same as the colors that were perceived by the observer. Obtaining color constant descriptors from image pixels is not only important for digital photography, but also valuable for computer vision, color-based automatic object recognition, and color image processing in general. This book provides a comprehensive introduction to the field of color constancy, describing all the major color constancy algorithms, as well as presenting cutting edge research in the area of color image processing. Beginning with an in-depth look at the human visual system, Ebner goes on to:  examine the theory of color image formation, color reproduction and different color spaces; discuss algorithms for color constancy under both uniform and non-uniform illuminants; describe methods for shadow removal and shadow attenuation in digital images; evaluate the various algorithms for object recognition and color constancy and compare this to data obtained from experimental psychology; set out the different algorithms as pseudo code in an appendix at the end of the book.  Color Constancy is an ideal reference for practising engineers, computer scientists and researchers working in the area of digital color image processing. It may also be useful for biologists or scientists in general who are interested in computational theories of the visual brain and bio-inspired engineering systems.},

We now report that ipRGCs are more abundant and diverse than previously appreciated, project more widely within the brain, and can support spatial visual perception. A Cre-based melanopsin reporter mouse line revealed at least five subtypes of ipRGCs with distinct morphological and physiological characteristics. Collectively, these cells project beyond the known brain targets of ipRGCs to heavily innervate the superior colliculus and dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus, retinotopically organized nuclei mediating object localization and discrimination. Mice lacking classical rod-cone photoreception, and thus entirely dependent on melanopsin for light detection, were able to discriminate grating stimuli from equiluminant gray and had measurable visual acuity. Thus, nonclassical retinal photoreception occurs within diverse cell types and influences circuits and functions encompassing luminance as well as spatial information.},

From the reflectance spectra of 1,565 Munsell color chips (glossy collection) color characteristic vectors are computed by using the Karhunen-Loeve transform (KLT). With the obtained color characteristic vectors, spectral reflectances of Macbeth ColorChecker's test colors are reconstructed and their spectra are shown graphically to see the fitness of our characteristic vectors. For each color, the chromaticity differences between the measured and reconstructed spectra were calculated and shown in the CIE xy chromaticity diagram. As a result, we can reconstruct the measured color reflectance spectra very closely by the first four characteristic vectors. With the first three characteristic vectors, however, color differences between the measured and reconstructed spectra were not negligible.},

Their distinct role, morphology, and molecular markers indicate that they are stereotyped circuit elements, but their physiological uniformity has not been investigated in a systematic fashion. We have profiled the biophysical parameters of mouse M1s and found that extreme variation is their hallmark. Most parameters span 1\textendash 3 log units, and the full range is evident in M1s that innervate brain regions serving divergent functions. Biophysical profiles differ among cells possessing similar morphology and between neighboring M1s recorded simultaneously. Variation in each parameter is largely independent of that in others, allowing for flexible individualization. Accordingly, a common stimulus drives heterogeneous spike outputs across cells. By contrast, a population of directionally selective retinal ganglion cells appeared physiologically uniform under similar conditions. Thus, M1s lack biophysical constancy and send diverse signals downstream.},

Rods and cones resolve details in the visual scene. Conversely, ipRGCs integrate over time and space, primarily to support ``non-image'' vision. The integrative mechanisms of ipRGCs are enigmatic, particularly since these cells use a phototransduction motif that allows invertebrates like Drosophila to parse light with exceptional temporal resolution. Here, we provide evidence for a single mechanism that allows ipRGCs to integrate over both time and wavelength. Light distributes the visual pigment, melanopsin, across three states, two silent and one signaling. Photoequilibration among states maintains pigment availability~for sustained signaling, stability of the signaling state~permits minutes-long temporal summation, and modest spectral separation of the silent states promotes uniform activation across wavelengths. By broadening the tuning of ipRGCs in both temporal and chromatic domains, melanopsin tristability produces signal integration for physiology and behavior.},

  abstract = {A longstanding and unresolved question is how observers construct a discrete set of color categories to partition and label the continuous variations in light spectra, and how these categories might reflect the neural representation of color. We explored the properties of color naming and its relationship to color appearance by analyzing individual differences in color-naming and hue-scaling patterns, using factor analysis of individual differences to identify separate and shared processes underlying hue naming (labeling) and hue scaling (color appearance). Observers labeled the hues of 36 stimuli spanning different angles in cone-opponent space, using a set of eight terms corresponding to primary (red, green, blue, yellow) or binary (orange, purple, blue-green, yellow-green) hues. The boundaries defining different terms varied mostly independently, reflecting the influence of at least seven to eight factors. This finding is inconsistent with conventional color-opponent models in which all colors derive from the relative responses of underlying red-green and blue-yellow dimensions. Instead, color categories may reflect qualitatively distinct attributes that are free to vary with the specific spectral stimuli they label. Inter-observer differences in color naming were large and systematic, and we examined whether these differences were associated with differences in color appearance by comparing the hue naming to color percepts assessed by hue scaling measured in the same observers (from Emery et al., 2017). Variability in both tasks again depended on multiple (7 or 8) factors, with some Varimax-rotated factors specific to hue naming or hue scaling, but others common to corresponding stimuli for both judgments. The latter suggests that at least some of the differences in how individuals name or categorize color are related to differences in how the stimuli are perceived.},

  abstract = {Forests exhibit much variation in light environments, and this can affect communication among animals, communication between animals and plants, photosynthesis, and plant morphogenesis. Light environments are caused by, and can be predicted from, the geometry of the light paths, the weather conditions, and the time of day. The structure of forests leads to four major light habitats when the sun is not blocked by clouds: forest shade, woodland shade, small gaps, and large gaps. These are characterized by yellow-green, blue-gray, reddish, and "white" ambient light spectra, respectively. When the sun is blocked by clouds, the spectra of these four habitats converge on that of large gaps and open areas, so the single light environment during cloudy weather will be called open/cloudy. An additional light environment (early/late) is associated with low sun angles (near dawn or dusk); it is purplish. Each light environment is well defined and was found in forests of Trinidad, Panama, Costa Rica, Australia, California, and Florida. Scattered literature references suggest similar patterns elsewhere in North America, Europe, and Java. Perceived colors of animals, flowers, and fruits depend upon the interaction between ambient light color and the reflectance color of the animal or plant parts. As a result, an animal or plant may have a different appearance in each environment, i.e., a color pattern may be relatively cryptic in some light environments while relatively conspicuous in others. This has strong implications for the joint evolution of visual signals and vision, as well as microhabitat choice. Plant growth and form may also be affected by variation in the color of forest light.},

  abstract = {We have built a hyperspectral database of 42 fruits and vegetables and this is a permanent online repository for public access to the calibrated data and its representation in different colorspaces (RGB, LAB, LUV, DKL, LMS, XYZ, xyY). For more complete details, you are advised to check the official webpage for the database and to read the journal article. The database can be found at: http://www.allpsych.uni-giessen.de/GHIFVD (pronounced ``gift'') The journal article that accompanies this repository is published in JOSA A: Ennis R., Schiller F., Toscani M., Gegenfurtner, K. (2018) "Hyperspectral database of fruits and vegetables", JOSA A, Vol. 35, No. 4., pp. B256-B266 and can be found here: https://www.osapublishing.org/josaa/abstract.cfm?uri=josaa-35-4-B256 Included here is the MATLAB code for opening the PCA compressed images. Both the outside (skin) and inside of the~objects were imaged. We used a Specim VNIR HS-CL-30-V8E-OEM mirror-scanning hyperspectral camera~and took pictures at a spatial resolution of {$\sim$}57 px/deg by 800 pixels at a wavelength resolution of~{$\sim$}1.12 nm. A stable, broadband illuminant was used. Images and software are freely available on our webserver~(http://www.allpsych.uni-giessen.de/GHIFVD; pronounced ``gift''). We performed two kinds of analyses on these~images. First, when comparing the insides and outsides of the objects, we observed that the insides were lighter~than the skins, and that the hues of the insides and skins were significantly correlated (circular~correlation 0.638). Second, we compared the color distribution within each object to corresponding human~color discrimination thresholds. We found a significant correlation (0.75) between the orientation of ellipses fit to~the chromaticity distributions of our fruits and vegetables with the orientations of interpolated MacAdam~discrimination ellipses. This indicates a relationship between sensory processing and the characteristic~of environmental objects. ~ If for some reason you need access to the original RAW data from the camera sensor, that can be found here: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1186372 However, it is only posted for preservation purposes.

For each spectrum, 20 participants rated a set of objects along continuous scales of naturalness, preference, vividness and skin preference. Most of the top rated spectra, along all four scales, had average gamut greater than or equal to 100 (IES Rg\,{$\geq$}\,100) and did not desaturate red hues (IES Rcs,h16\,{$\geq$}\,0\%). Best fit models illustrate that average fidelity (i.e. IES Rf) and a proxy for red saturation (i.e. IES Rcs,h16, Rcs,h1) are salient derived measures. The results illustrate that a two-metric system of colour rendition, comprised of average metrics for fidelity and gamut, cannot fully describe colour quality and underscore the importance of a colour rendering graphic (i.e. IES Colour Vector Graphic). We propose and illustrate the utility of quantifying the shape of the IES TM-30-15 Color Vector Graphic with a best-fit ellipse.},

Ishihara under Exner's supervision at the beginning of the century. Rushton provided a theoretical framework for the method with the enunciation of his ``principle of univariance'', In this paper we show how the ``silent substitution'' concept can be further generalized to any arbitrary number of photoreceptor classes by making use of well-established concepts of colorimetry. With this approach, which we have called ``spectral compensation'', one also gains a better insight into the possibilities and shortcomings of the technique. To illustrate this, we apply our approach to examine a number of published studies where use has been made of ``silent substitution'', with particular emphasis on the work of W.A.H. Rushton.},

Because the visual system does not provide adequate neurophysiological discontinuities to supply natural color category boundaries, and because recent evidence points to a linguistic origin (Davidoff, Davies, \& Roberson, 1999), a new approach was used to investigate the controversial issue of the origin of color categories. Baboons and humans were given the same task of matching-to-sample colors that crossed the blue/green boundary. The data and consequent modeling were remarkably clear-cut. All human subjects matched our generalization probe stimuli as if to a sharp boundary close to the midpoint between their training items. Despite good color discrimination, none of the baboons showed any inclination to match to a single boundary but rather responded with two boundaries close to the training stimuli. The data give no support to the claim that color categories are explicitly instantiated in the primate color vision system.},

Three observers adjusted the chromaticity of test stimuli to produce an achromatic appearance under a variety of adapting conditions. The achromatic-appearing chromaticities were used as measures of the observers' states of chromatic adaptation. The spatial configuration of the adapting background was varied to measure the spatial extent of the mechanisms responsible for chromatic adaptation. The temporal configuration of the adapting background was varied to measure the time-course of these mechanisms. The results show that chromatic adaptation is spatially localized with a time-course on the order of 10 sec. Since the mechanisms were shown to be spatially localized, the observed temporal integration across eye movements is required to allow these mechanisms to adjust to the spatially integrated scene chromaticity.},

  abstract = {Traditional color appearance modeling has recently matured to the point that available, internationally recommended models such as CIECAM02 are capable of making a wide range of predictions, to within the observer variability in color matching and color scaling of stimuli, in somewhat simplified viewing conditions. It is proposed that the next significant advances in the field of color appearance modeling and image quality metrics will not come from evolutionary revisions of colorimetric color appearance models alone. Instead, a more revolutionary approach will be required to make appearance and difference predictions for more complex stimuli in a wider array of viewing conditions. Such an approach can be considered image appearance modeling, since it extends the concepts of color appearance modeling to stimuli and viewing environments that are spatially and temporally at the level of complexity of real natural and man-made scenes, and extends traditional image quality metrics into the color appearance domain. Thus, two previously parallel and evolving research areas are combined in a new way as an attempt to instigate a significant advance. We review the concepts of image appearance modeling, present iCAM as one example of such a model, and provide a number of examples of the use of iCAM in image reproduction and image quality evaluation. \textcopyright{} 2004 SPIE and IS\&T.},

Such an expansion is most tractable in color technology applications when it is homogenous. However, more often a true principal-component analysis (PCA) is performed, which involves an offset of the expansion by a mean spectrum. In deference to custom, we discuss and exercise the traditional PCA on reflectances. We review the method of calculation and present tables of the principal components of 3,534 object-color samples from three color-order systems. Next, we describe two kinds of principal-component coordinates of a measured reflectance spectrum, one obtained by least-square best fit and the other by tristimulus match under one or more specified lights. Finally, we show illustrative examples, and propose some possible new uses for principal-component analysis of reflectances. \textcopyright{} 2004 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

The feature-similarity gain model predicts a graded modulation, whereas an alternative model asserts an inhibitory surround in feature space. Although evidence for both types of modulations can be found, a consensus has not emerged in the literature. Here, we aimed to reconcile these different views by systematically measuring how attention modulates color perception. Based on previous literature, we also predicted that color categories would impact attentional modulation. Our results showed that both surround suppression and feature-similarity gain modulate perception of colors but they operate on different similarity scales. Furthermore, the region of the suppressive surround coincided with the color category boundary, suggesting a categorical sharpening effect. We implemented a neural population coding model to explain the observed behavioral effects, which revealed a hitherto unknown connection between neural tuning shift and surround suppression.},

  abstract = {For a camera image, the RGB response from the imaging sensor cannot be used to drive display devices directly. The reason behind this is two-fold: different cameras have different spectral sensitivities, and there are different target output spaces (e.g. sRGB, Adobe RGB, and XYZ). The process of mapping from captured RGBs to an output colour space is called colour correction. Colour Correction is of interest in its own right (e.g. for colour measurement), but it is also an important part of the colour processing pipelines found in digital cameras. In this paper, we look at the problem of mapping device RGB values to corresponding CIE XYZ tristimuli. We make three contributions. First, we review and implement a range of colour correction algorithms. We benchmark these algorithms in experiments using both synthetic data (so we can numerically assess a wider range of cameras) and real image data. In our second contribution, we develop an ensemble method to combine colour correction algorithms to further enhance performance. For the methods tested, we find there is small extra power in combining the methods. Our final \textemdash{} and perhaps most important contribution \textemdash{} is to provide an open source colour correction MATLAB toolbox for the community, implementing the algorithms described in the paper. As well, all our experimental data is provided.},

  abstract = {{$<$}h3{$>$}Abstract{$<$}/h3{$>$} {$<$}p{$>$}Achromatopsia (ACHM) is an inherited retinal disease characterised by complete loss of cone photoreceptor function from birth. In recent years, gene therapies have successfully been used to induce signal processing in dormant cones in animal models of ACHM, with greater functional benefits for younger animals. With several completed or on-going clinical trials of gene therapy for ACHM, preliminary evidence suggests that effects on visual function in adults with ACHM may be subtle. Given the known constraints of age on neural plasticity, it is possible that gene therapy earlier in life will have a greater impact. Sensitive, child-friendly tests of cone function are therefore needed to facilitate the optimisation of these treatment strategies. Here, we present a new method that leverages a multimodal approach, linking psychophysical estimates of cone function to cone-mediated signals in visual cortex, measured using fMRI. In a case study of two children with ACHM undergoing gene therapy, we find individual differences in recovery of cone function over time, with one child demonstrating strong concurrent evidence of improved cone function, and retinotopically organised responses in visual cortex to cone-selective stimuli. Integrated fMRI and psychophysical measures may provide insight into the utility of new sight-rescuing therapies at different stages of human development.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {Spatially explicit information on tree species composition of managed and natural forests, plantations and urban vegetation provides valuable information for nature conservationists as well as for forest and urban managers and is frequently required over large spatial extents. Over the last four decades, advances in remote sensing technology have enabled the classification of tree species from several sensor types. While studies using remote sensing data to classify and map tree species reach back several decades, a recent review on the status, potentials, challenges and outlooks in this realm is missing. Here, we search for major trends in remote sensing techniques for tree species classification and discuss the effectiveness of different sensors and algorithms based on a literature review. This review demonstrates that the number of studies focusing on tree species classification has increased constantly over the last four decades and promising local scale approaches have been presented for several sensor types. However, there are few examples for tree species classifications over large geographic extents, and bridging the gap between current approaches and tree species inventories over large geographic extents is still one of the biggest challenges of this research field. Furthermore, we found only few studies which systematically described and examined the traits that drive the observed variance in the remote sensing signal and thereby enable or hamper species classifications. Most studies followed data-driven approaches and pursued an optimization of classification accuracy, while a concrete hypothesis or a targeted application was missing in all but a few exceptional studies. We recommend that future research efforts focus stronger on the causal understanding of why tree species classification approaches work under certain conditions or \textendash{} maybe even more important - why they do not work in other cases. This might require more complex field acquisitions than those typically used in the reviewed studies. At the same time, we recommend reducing the number of purely data-driven studies and algorithm-benchmarking studies as these studies are of limited value, especially if the experimental design is limited, e.g. the tree population is not representative and only a few sensors or acquisition settings are simultaneously investigated.},

  abstract = {Color constancy is the ability to recognize the color of objects independent of the light source luminance. Color processing and especially color constancy performs an important role in computer vision and image processing applications such as image retrieval, image classification, color object recognition, and object tracking. Color constancy is usually understood as the task of finding descriptors which are invariant to illumination changes in surfaces of a scene while correcting colors in an image is considered as a different phase. This paper proposes a new combinational method based on fuzzy method and clustering to estimate the chromaticity of the light source as the major step of color constancy. In this algorithm, after fuzzification different features of the image by using a clustering algorithm estimates the light source illuminant. To verify the proposed method, four well-known algorithms were selected based on the best algorithm by the proposed approach. In selecting these methods, it was tried to choose the ones which had better performance in comparison to other methods. It is shown in this article that the proposed approach performs better than other proposed methods for color constancy most of the time.},

We present a Bayesian model to explain why this reduced discriminability might occur: It arises as a consequence of optimally solving the statistical problem of perception in noise. In the optimal solution to this problem, listeners' perception is biased toward phonetic category means because they use knowledge of these categories to guide their inferences about speakers' target productions. Simulations show that model predictions closely correspond to previously published human data, and novel experimental results provide evidence for the predicted link between perceptual warping and noise. The model unifies several previous accounts of the perceptual magnet effect and provides a framework for exploring categorical effects in other domains.},

  abstract = {The Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function (BRDF) is essential to characterize an object's reflectance properties. This function depends both on the various illumination-observation geometries as well as on the wavelength. As a result, the comprehensive interpretation of the data becomes rather complex. In this work we assess the use of the multivariable analysis technique of Principal Components Analysis (PCA) applied to the experimental BRDF data of a ceramic colour standard. It will be shown that the result may be linked to the various reflection processes occurring on the surface, assuming that the incoming spectral distribution is affected by each one of these processes in a specific manner. Moreover, this procedure facilitates the task of interpolating a series of BRDF measurements obtained for a particular sample.},

  abstract = {The choice of the representation space is relevant when analysing the results of a colour memory experiment. If we are interested in determining which colours are best or worst remembered using the colour difference between the reference and matching stimuli, we need spaces with a high degree of uniformity. In this paper, the results of a previous experiment with 10 colours, 100 observers and three time gaps have been processed in five representation spaces with different uniformity degrees: CIE , CIE , SVF, Rlab and Llab. For most colours and in all the spaces, reference colours above a particular lightness value are remembered as even lighter, whereas below a certain value they are remembered as darker or equally light. Chroma either increases or suffers no variations. Changes in hue appear to be, in contrast, unsystematic. These results basically agree with the previous literature. CIE , CIE and Rlab spaces yield practically identical results. The best remembered colours are orange and oxide red, and yellow is the worst remembered colour. In the SVF space, the worst remembered colours are blue and yellow, although the results for pink become comparable as the delay increases. Pink is also the worst remembered colour in the Llab space. R\'esum\'e. Le choix d'un espace de repr\'esentation est primordial pour analyser les r\'esultats des exp\'eriences sur la m\'emoire des couleurs. Quand on veut utiliser la difference entre la couleur de r\'ef\'erence et la couleur m\'emoris\'ee pour d\'eterminer quelles sont les couleurs qu'on se rappele le mieux ou celles qu'on se rappele le moins bien, on a besoin d'un espace aussi uniforme que possible. Ce travail montre les conclusions obtenues en analysant dans les espaces CIE , CIE , SVF, Rlab et Llab les r\'esultats d'une exp\'erience pr\'ealable, r\'ealis\'ee avec 10 \'echantillons colour\'es, 100 observateurs et 3 temps de retard diff\'erents. Dans tous les espaces et pour la plupart des couleurs, les observateurs se rappelaient comme plus clairs les \'echantillons de r\'ef\'erence dont la clart\'e d\'epassait une certaine valeur, tandis que ceux dont la clart\'e \'etait inferieure \`a une autre valeur \'etaient m\'emoris\'es comme \'egalement clairs ou plus obscurs. La saturation restait constante ou augmentait. Par contre, les variations du teint n'\'etaient pas systematiques. Ces r\'esultats sont essentielement en accord avec ceux de la litt\'erature. Les r\'esultats obtenus avec les espaces CIE , CIE et Rlab sont \`a peu pr\`es identiques: les couleurs m\'emoris\'ees le mieux sont l'orange et le rouge oxide, tandis que le jaune est le pire. Dans l'espace SVF, les couleurs qu'on se rappele le moins bien sont le bleu et le jaune, bien que la performance pour l'\'echantillon rose devienne aussi mauvaise quand le temps de retard augmente jusqu'a 24 heures. Le rose est aussi la couleur la moins bien m\'emoris\'ee dans l'espace Llab.

First, responses of rods increased linearly with flash strength, while those of rod bipolars increased supralinearly. Second, fluctuations in the responses of rod bipolars were larger than expected from linear summation of the rod inputs. Rod-OFF bipolar signal transfer did not share this strong nonlinearity. Surprisingly, nonlinear rod-rod bipolar signal transfer eliminated many of the rod's single-photon responses. The impact on sensitivity, however, was more than compensated for by rejection of noise from rods that did not absorb photons. As a consequence, rod bipolars provide a near-optimal readout of rod signals at light levels near visual threshold.},

  abstract = {The relative efficiency of any particular image-coding scheme should be defined only in relation to the class of images that the code is likely to encounter. To understand the representation of images by the mammalian visual system, it might therefore be useful to consider the statistics of images from the natural environment (i.e., images with trees, rocks, bushes, etc). In this study, various coding schemes are compared in relation to how they represent the information in such natural images. The coefficients of such codes are represented by arrays of mechanisms that respond to local regions of space, spatial frequency, and orientation (Gabor-like transforms). For many classes of image, such codes will not be an efficient means of representing information. However, the results obtained with six natural images suggest that the orientation and the spatial-frequency tuning of mammalian simple cells are well suited for coding the information in such images if the goal of the code is to convert higher-order redundancy (e.g., correlation between the intensities of neighboring pixels) into first-order redundancy (i.e., the response distribution of the coefficients). Such coding produces a relatively high signal-to-noise ratio and permits information to be transmitted with only a subset of the total number of cells. These results support Barlow's theory that the goal of natural vision is to represent the information in the natural environment with minimal redundancy.},

Forsyth's method invokes the constraint that the surface colors under a canonical illuminant all fall within an established maximal convex gamut of possible colors. However, the method works only when restrictive conditions are imposed on the world: the illumination must be uniform, the surfaces must be planar, and there can be no specularities. To overcome these restrictions, we modify Forsyth's algorithm so that it works with the colors under a perspective projection (in a chromaticity space). The new algorithm working in perspective is simpler than Forsyth's method and more importantly the restrictions on the illuminant, surface shape and specularities can be relaxed. The algorithm is then extended to include a maximal gamut constraint on a set of illuminants that is analogous to the gamut constraint on surface colors. Tests on real images show that the algorithm provides good color constancy.},

Obtaining such an estimate is a central part of solving the color constancy problem. Thus, the work presented will have applications in fields such as color-based object recognition and digital photography. Rather than attempting to recover a single estimate of the illuminant, we instead set out to recover a measure of the likelihood that each of a set of possible illuminants was the scene illuminant. We begin by determining which image colors can occur (and how these colors are distributed) under each of a set of possible lights. We discuss how, for a given camera, we can obtain this knowledge. We then correlate this information with the colors in a particular image to obtain a measure of the likelihood that each of the possible lights was the scene illuminant. Finally, we use this likelihood information to choose a single light as an estimate of the scene illuminant. Computation is expressed and performed in a generic correlation framework which we develop. We propose a new probabilistic instantiation of this correlation framework and show that it delivers very good color constancy on both synthetic and real images. We further show that the proposed framework is rich enough to allow many existing algorithms to be expressed within it: the gray-world and gamut-mapping algorithms are presented in this framework and we also explore the relationship of these algorithms to other probabilistic and neural network approaches to color constancy},

Perhaps the most widely used publically available dataset used in illuminant estimation is Gehler's Colour Checker set that was reprocessed by Shi and Funt.

  abstract = {Much of image processing and vision uses 3 sensors because we ourselves have trichromatic vision. However, some solutions to vision problems use additional hardware not available to ourselves in order to get the best performance. For example, the idea of placing a coloured filter in front of a vision system, and capturing two images: one with-and another one without the filter has recently been revisited in the context of the illumination estimation problem. It was shown that the plus-filter illuminant estimation is easier to solve and so it is easier to estimate and discount illumination compared with traditional methods. In this paper we propose that this two image approach is in fact plausible for human visual processing. Indeed, a little known and little explained optical fact is that the light striking the central part of the retina is pre-filtered with a yellow filter (the macular pigment) but no pre-filtering occurs to light striking other parts of the retina. Since the world we see is a composite of several images taken at different fixation points we argue that the visual system in principle has access to two images: normal RGBs + RGBs measured through a yellow filter. Experiments demonstrate that the illumination estimation performance that is possible starting with the human vision system sensitivities is excellent and as for machine vision is much better than the non plus-filter algorithms. We discuss the wider relevance of this result to the vision and imaging community.},

  abstract = {Colour can potentially provide useful information for a variety of computer vision tasks such as image segmentation, image retrieval, object recognition and tracking. However, for it to be helpful in practice, colour must relate directly to the intrinsic properties of the imaged objects and be independent of imaging conditions such as scene illumination and the imaging device. To this end many invariant colour representations have been proposed in the literature. Unfortunately, recent work (Second Workshop on Content-based Multimedia Indexing) has shown that none of them provides good enough practical performance. In this paper we propose a new colour invariant image representation based on an existing grey-scale image enhancement technique: histogram equalisation. We show that provided the rank ordering of sensor responses are preserved across a change in imaging conditions (lighting or device) a histogram equalisation of each channel of a colour image renders it invariant to these conditions. We set out theoretical conditions under which rank ordering of sensor responses is preserved and we present empirical evidence which demonstrates that rank ordering is maintained in practice for a wide range of illuminants and imaging devices. Finally, we apply the method to an image indexing application and show that the method out performs all previous invariant representations, giving close to perfect illumination invariance and very good performance across a change in device.},

  abstract = {Colour constancy algorithms attempt to estimate and then remove the colour of the prevailing illuminant. Since, only when this is done, can image colour be used as a cue for reflectance and so usefully subserve tasks such as tracking and recognition. Broadly speaking, there are two ways to estimate the illuminant. First, we might calculate a simple statistic, such as the mean, from the image and argue that this should correlate with light colour. Second, we incorporate physical knowledge and probabilistic inference to arrive at the estimate. The latter approach results in significantly better performance though, often at significant computational cost. In this paper we present a simple statistical approach which, given only knowledge of the RGBs of typical lights, results in performance close to that delivered by more complex algorithms. The paper begins with the observation that the two simplest statistical estimators, the mean and max RGB responses, are respectively the L1 and L{$\infty$} norms. We show then that an LP norm might also be used as an estimator. The theory is then developed to allow a prior constraint to be placed on the illuminant (natural and artificial lights are often bluish, whitish and yellowish but are rarely purple). Experiments on the Simon Fraser calibrated data set show that the illuminant can be reliably estimated using a constrained L4 norm. Moreover, performance is comparable to the most advanced methods.},

  abstract = {Still, much of computer vision is predicated on greyscale imagery. There are good reasons for this. For much of the development of computer vision greyscale images were all that was available and so techniques were developed for that medium. Equally, if a problem can be solved in greyscale - and many can be - then the added complexity of starting with 3 image planes as oppose to 1 is not needed. But, truthfully, colour is not used ubiquitously as there are some important concepts that need to be understood if colour is to be used correctly. In this chapter I summarise the basic model of colour image formation which teaches that the colours recorded by a camera depend equally on the colour of the prevailing light and the colour of objects in the scene. Building on this, some of the fundamental ideas of colorimetry are discussed in the context of colour correction: the process whereby acquired camera RGBs are mapped to the actual RGBs used to drive a display. Then, we discuss how we can remove colour bias due to illumination. Two methods are presented: we can solve for the colour of the light (colour constancy) or remove it through algebraic manipulation (illuminant invariance). Either approach is necessary if colour is to be used as a descriptor for problems such as recognition and tracking. The chapter also touches on aspects of human perception.},

However we noticed that this metric is not in line with how the illuminant estimates are used. Normally, the illuminant estimates are `divided out' from the image to, hopefully, provide image colors that are not confounded by the color of the light. However, even though the same reproduction results the same scene might have a large range of recovery errors. In this work the scale of the problem with the recovery error is quantified. Next we propose a new metric for evaluating illuminant estimation algorithms, called the reproduction angular error, which is defined as the angle between the RGB of a white surface when the actual and estimated illuminations are `divided out'. Our new metric ties algorithm performance to how the illuminant estimates are used. For a given algorithm, adopting the new reproduction angular error leads to different optimal parameters. Further the ranked list of best to worst algorithms changes when the reproduction angular is used. The importance of using an appropriate performance metric is established.},

To solve the colour constancy problem we estimate the colour of the prevailing light and then, at the second stage, remove it.Two of the most commonly used simple techniques for estimating the colour of the light are the Grey-World and Max-RGB algorithms. In this paper we begin by observing that this two colour constancy computations will respectively return the right answer if the average scene colour is grey or the maximum is white (and conversely, the degree of failure is proportional to the extent that these assumptions hold). We go on to ask the following question: ``Would we perform better colour constancy by assuming the scene average is some shade of grey?''. We give a mathematical answer to this question. Firstly, we show that Max-RGB and Grey-World are two instantiations of Minkowski norm. Secondly, that for a large calibrated dataset L 6 norm colour constancy works best overall (we have improved the performance achieved by a simple normalization based approach). Surprisingly we found performance to be similar to more elaborated algorithm.},

  abstract = {Received March 8, 1993; revised manuscript accepted October 28, 1993; accepted October 28, 1993 We develop sensor transformations, collectively called spectral sharpening, that convert a given set of sensor sensitivity functions into a new set that will improve the performance of any color-constancy algorithm that is based on an independent adjustment of the sensor response channels. Independent adjustment of multiplicative coefficients corresponds to the application of a diagonal-matrix transform (DMT) to the sensor response vector and is a common feature of many theories of color constancy, Land's retinex and von Kries adaptation in particular. We set forth three techniques for spectral sharpening. Sensor-based sharpening focuses on the production of new sensors as linear combinations of the given ones such that each new sensor has its spectral sensitivity concentrated as much as possible within a narrow band of wavelengths. Databased sharpening, on the other hand, extracts new sensors by optimizing the ability of a DMT to account for a given illumination change by examining the sensor response vectors obtained from a set of surfaces under two different illuminants. Finally in perfect sharpening we demonstrate that, if illumination and surface reflectance are described by two- and three-parameter finite-dimensional models, there exists a unique optimal sharpening transform. All three sharpening methods yield similar results. When sharpened cone sensitivities are used as sensors, a DMT models illumination change extremely well. We present simulation results suggesting that in general nondiagonal transforms can do only marginally better. Our sharpening results correlate well with the psychophysical evidence of spectral sharpening in the human visual system.},

  abstract = {One of the hallmarks of human cognition is cognitive flexibility, the ability to adapt thoughts and behaviors according to changing task demands. Previous research has suggested that the number of different exemplars that must be processed within a task (the set size) can influence an individual's ability to switch flexibly between different tasks. This paper provides evidence that when tasks have a small set size, children's cognitive flexibility is impaired compared to when tasks have a large set size. This paper also offers insights into the mechanism by which this effect comes about. Understanding how set size interacts with task-switching informs the debate regarding the relative contributions of bottom-up priming and top-down control processes in the development of cognitive flexibility. We tested two accounts for the relationship between set size and cognitive flexibility: the (bottom-up) Stimulus-Task Priming account and the (top-down) Rule Representation account. Our findings offered support for the Stimulus-Task Priming account, but not for the Rule Representation account. They suggest that children are susceptible to bottom-up priming caused by stimulus repetition, and that this priming can impair their ability to switch between tasks. These findings make important theoretical and practical contributions to the executive function literature: theoretically, they show that the basic features of a task exert a significant influence on children's ability to flexibly shift between tasks through bottom-up priming effects. Practically, they suggest that children's cognitive flexibility may have been underestimated relative to adults', as paradigms used with children typically have a smaller set size than those used with adults. These findings also have applications in education, where they have the potential to inform teaching in key areas where cognitive flexibility is required, such as mathematics and literacy.},

We first selected the patches for which the units are maximally responsive among the 1.2~M images of the ImageNet training dataset. We segmented these patches using a k-means clustering algorithm on their chromatic distribution. Then we independently varied the color of these segments, both in hue and chroma, to measure the unit's chromatic tuning. The models exhibited properties at times similar or opposed to the known chromatic processing of biological system. We found that, similarly to the most anterior occipital visual areas in primates, the last convolutional layer exhibited high color sensitivity. We also found the gradual emergence of single to double opponent kernels. Contrary to cells in the visual system, however, these kernels were selective for hues that gradually transit from being broadly distributed in early layers, to mainly falling along the blue-orange axis in late layers. In addition, we found that the classification performance of our models varies as we change the color of our stimuli following the models' kernels properties. Performance was highest for colors the kernels maximally responded to, and images responsible for the activation of color sensitive kernels were more likely to be mis-classified as we changed their color. These observations were shared by all three networks, thus suggesting that they are general properties of current convolutional neural networks trained for object recognition.},

Here, we trained deep neural networks to be color constant and evaluated their performance with varying cues. Inputs to the networks consisted of the cone excitations in 3D-rendered images of 2115 different 3D-shapes, with spectral reflectances of 1600 different Munsell chips, illuminated under 278 different natural illuminations. The models were trained to classify the reflectance of the objects. One network, Deep65, was trained under a fixed daylight D65 illumination, while DeepCC was trained under varying illuminations. Testing was done with 4 new illuminations with equally spaced CIEL*a*b* chromaticities, 2 along the daylight locus and 2 orthogonal to it. We found a high degree of color constancy for DeepCC, and constancy was higher along the daylight locus. When gradually removing cues from the scene, constancy decreased. High levels of color constancy were achieved with different DNN architectures. Both ResNets and classical ConvNets of varying degrees of complexity performed well. However, DeepCC, a convolutional network, represented colors along the 3 color dimensions of human color vision, while ResNets showed a more complex representation.},

  abstract = {In order to explore the metric structure of the space of remembered colors, a computer game was designed, where players with normal color vision had to store a color in memory, and later retrieve it by selecting the best match out of a continuum of alternatives. All tested subjects exhibited evidence of focal colors in their mnemonic strategy. We found no concluding evidence that the focal colors of different players tended to cluster around universal prototypes. Based on the Fisher metric, for each subject we defined a notion of distance in color space that captured the accuracy with which similar colors where discriminated or confounded when stored and retrieved from memory. The notions of distance obtained for different players were remarkably similar. Finally, for each player, we constructed a new color scale, in which colors are memorized and retrieved with uniform accuracy.},

Such labeling clearly facilitates communicating about colors, but does it also impact color perception? We demonstrate that simply hearing color words enhances categorical color perception, improving people's accuracy in discriminating between simultaneously presented colors in an untimed task. Immediately after hearing a color word participants were better able to distinguish between colors from the named category and colors from nearby categories. Discrimination between typical and atypical category members was also enhanced. Verbal cues slightly decreased discrimination accuracy between two typical shades of the named color. In contrast to verbal cues, a preview of the target color, an arguably more informative cue, failed to yield any changes to discrimination accuracy. The finding that color words strongly affect color discrimination accuracy suggests that categorical color perception may be caused by color representations being augmented in-the-moment by language.

However, sustained scientific investigation has not yet provided solid evidence for a neural representation that separates the unique hues from other colors. We measured event-related potentials elicited from unique hues and the `intermediate' hues in between them. We find a neural signature of the unique hues 230 ms after stimulus onset at a post-perceptual stage of visual processing. Specifically, the posterior P2 component over the parieto-occipital lobe peaked significantly earlier for the unique than for the intermediate hues (Z = -2.9, p = 0.004). Having identified a neural marker for unique hues, fundamental questions about the contribution of neural hardwiring, language and environment to the unique hues can now be addressed.},

  abstract = {Colour constancy is a skill by which people can tell the`colour of an object correctly, even when it is illuminated by strongly coloured lights. I derive the colour constancy equation, and obtain from this derivation the circumstances under which colour constancy is possible. I then employ the properties of surface reflectance functions to turn colour constancy into a parameter estimation problem. This leads in a natural way to two novel algorithms for colour constancy, distinguished by the assumptions required of the world for their success. The first, called Crule, succeeds on all surface reflectances under restrictions on the illuminant and corresponds to normalisation according to a coefficient rule. A physical realisability argument provides a strong constraint on the coefficients for this kind of normalisation. Within the region that satisfies this constraint, an estimator is used to select a set of coefficients for predicting colour appearance. The second algorithm, called Mwext, although a natural extension of recent work of Maloney and Wandell, is complex and restrictive in its requirements of the world. I show that these algorithms achieve colour constancy on real pictures. I show that this formalism is capable of reproducing qualitative aspects of Land's two colour experiments. I compare the Crule algorithm with a model of the Retinex algorithm of Land and show that the descriptors computed by the Crule algorithm are not as strongly dependent on the structure of the scene as those computed by the Retinex algorithm. Finally, I show that colour constancy can improve the quality of image segmentation, and is hence a useful and important technique for machine vision. A comprehensive review of the literature treating colour constancy in machine and human vision is provided.},

  abstract = {Color constancy is the skill by which it is possible to tell the color of an object even under a colored light. I interpret the color of an object as its color under a fixed canonical light, rather than as a surface reflectance function. This leads to an analysis that shows two distinct sets of circumstances under which color constancy is possible. In this framework, color constancy requires estimating the illuminant under which the image was taken. The estimate is then used to choose one of a set of linear maps, which is applied to the image to yield a color descriptor at each point. This set of maps is computed in advance. The illuminant can be estimated using image measurements alone, because, given a number of weak assumptions detailed in the text, the color of the illuminant is constrained by the colors observed in the image. This constraint arises from the fact that surfaces can reflect no more light than is cast on them. For example, if one observes a patch that excites the red receptor strongly, the illuminant cannot have been deep blue. Two algorithms are possible using this constraint, corresponding to different assumptions about the world. The first algorithm, Crule will work for any surface reflectance. Crule corresponds to a form of coefficient rule, but obtains the coefficients by using constraints on illuminant color. The set of illuminants for which Crule will be successful depends strongly on the choice of photoreceptors: for narrowband photoreceptors, Crule will work in an unrestricted world. The second algorithm, Mwext, requires that both surface reflectances and illuminants be chosen from finite dimensional spaces; but under these restrictive conditions it can recover a large number of parameters in the illuminant, and is not an attractive model of human color constancy. Crule has been tested on real images of Mondriaans, and works well. I show results for Crule and for the Retinex algorithm of Land (Land 1971; Land 1983; Land 1985) operating on a number of real images. The experimental work shows that for good constancy, a color constancy system will need to adjust the gain of the receptors it employs in a fashion analagous to adaptation in humans.},

  abstract = {Variations in illumination on a scene and trichromatic sampling by the eye limit inferences about scene content. The aim of this work was to elucidate these limits in relation to an ideal observer using color signals alone. Simulations were based on 50 hyperspectral images of natural scenes and daylight illuminants with correlated color temperatures 4000 K, 6500 K, and 25,000 K. Estimates were made of the (Shannon) information available from each scene, the redundancies in receptoral and postreceptoral coding, and the information retrieved by an observer identifying corresponding points across image pairs. For the largest illuminant difference, between 25,000 K and 4000 K, a postreceptoral transformation providing minimum redundancy yielded an efficiency of about 80\% in the information retrieved. This increased to about 89\% when the transformation was optimized directly for information retrieved, corresponding to an equivalent Gaussian noise amplitude of 3.0\% or to a mean of 3.6\texttimes 104 distinct identifiable points per scene. Using color signals to retrieve information from natural scenes can approach ideal observer efficiency levels.},

At about the same time, new models of color constancy appeared, along with physiological data on cortical mechanisms and photographic colorimetric measurements of natural scenes. Since then, as this review shows, there have been many advances. The theoretical requirements for constancy have been better delineated and the range of experimental techniques has been greatly expanded; novel invariant properties of images and a variety of neural mechanisms have been identified; and increasing recognition has been given to the relevance of natural surfaces and scenes as laboratory stimuli. Even so, there remain many theoretical and experimental challenges, not least to develop an account of color constancy that goes beyond deterministic and relatively simple laboratory stimuli and instead deals with the intrinsically variable nature of surfaces and illuminations present in the natural world.},

Spectral sensitivities have also been obtained, in part at least, for the subsequent post-receptoral neural pathways that apparently recode colour information into separate signals specifying luminance and chromaticity. These and other findings on receptoral and post-receptoral spectral sensitivities are considered in relation to techniques for functionally isolating colour-processing pathways in the human visual system.

  abstract = {Collectively the daily, seasonal, lunar and tidal geophysical cycles regulate much of the temporal biology of life on Earth. The increasing isolation of human societies from these geophysical cycles, as a result of improved living conditions, high-quality nutrition and 24/7 working practices, have led many to believe that human biology functions independently of them. Yet recent studies have highlighted the dominant role that our circadian clock plays in the organisation of 24 hour patterns of behaviour and physiology. Preferred wake and sleep times are to a large extent driven by an endogenous temporal program that uses sunlight as an entraining cue. The alarm clock can drive human activity rhythms but has little direct effect on our endogenous 24 hour physiology. In many situations, our biology and our society appear to be in serious opposition, and the damaging consequences to our health under these circumstances are increasingly recognised. The seasons dominate the lives of non-equatorial species, and until recently, they also had a marked influence on much of human biology. Despite human isolation from seasonal changes in temperature, food and photoperiod in the industrialised nations, the seasons still appear to have a small, but significant, impact upon when individuals are born and many aspects of health. The seasonal changes that modulate our biology, and how these factors might interact with the social and metabolic status of the individual to drive seasonal effects, are still poorly understood. Lunar cycles had, and continue to have, an influence upon human culture, though despite a persistent belief that our mental health and other behaviours are modulated by the phase of the moon, there is no solid evidence that human biology is in any way regulated by the lunar cycle.},

The main types of hyperspectral cameras are described together with procedures for image acquisition, postprocessing, and calibration for either radiance or reflectance data. Image transformations are defined for colorimetric representations, color rendering, and cone receptor and postreceptor coding. Several example applications are also presented. These include calculating the color properties of scenes, such as gamut volume and metamerism, and analyzing the utility of color in observer tasks, such as identifying surfaces under illuminant changes. The effects of noise and uncertainty are considered in both image acquisition and color vision applications.},

  abstract = {Colour constancy is traditionally interpreted as the stable appearance of the colour of a surface despite changes in the spectral composition of the illumination. When colour constancy has been assessed quantitatively, however, by observers making matches between surfaces illuminated by different sources, its completeness has been found to be poor. An alternative operational approach to colour constancy may he taken which concentrates instead on detecting the underlying chromatic relationship between the parts of a surface under changes in the illuminant. Experimentally the observer's task was to determine whether a change in the appearance of a surface was due to a change in its reflecting properties or to a change in the incident light. Observers viewed computer simulations of a row of three Mondrian patterns of Munsell chips. The centre pattern was a reference pattern illuminated by a simulated, spatially uniform daylight; one of the outer patterns was identical but illuminated by a different daylight; and the other outer pattern was equivalent but not obtainable from the centre pattern by such a change in illuminant. Different patterns and different shifts in daylight were generated in each experimental trial. The task of the observer was to identify which of the outer patterns was the result of an illuminant change. Observers made reliable discriminations of the patterns with displays of durations from several seconds to less than 200 ms, and for one observer, with displays of 1 ms. By these measures, human observers appear capable of colour constancy that is extremely rapid, and probably preattentive in origin.},

  abstract = {If surfaces in a scene are to be distinguished by their color, their neural representation at some level should ideally vary little with the color of the illumination. Four possible neural codes were considered: von-Kries-scaled cone responses from single points in a scene, spatial ratios of cone responses produced by light reflected from pairs of points, and these quantities obtained with sharpened (opponent-cone) responses. The effectiveness of these codes in identifying surfaces was quantified by information-theoretic measures. Data were drawn from a sample of 25 rural and urban scenes imaged with a hyperspectral camera, which provided estimates of surface reflectance at 10-nm intervals at each of 1344 ϫ 1024 pixels for each scene. In computer simulations, scenes were illuminated separately by daylights of correlated color temperatures 4000 K, 6500 K, and 25,000 K. Points were sampled randomly in each scene and identified according to each of the codes. It was found that the maximum information preserved under illuminant changes varied with the code, but for a particular code it was remarkably stable across the different scenes. The standard deviation over the 25 scenes was, on average, approximately 1 bit, suggesting that the neural coding of surface color can be optimized independent of location for any particular range of illuminants.},

This color constancy can be measured operationally by asking observers to distinguish illuminant changes on a scene from changes in the reflecting properties of the surfaces comprising it. It is shown here that during fast illuminant changes, simultaneous changes in spectral reflectance of one or more surfaces in an array of other surfaces can be readily detected almost independent of the numbers of surfaces, suggesting a preattentive, spatially parallel process. This process, which is perfect over a spatial window delimited by the anatomical fovea, may form an early input to a multistage analysis of surface color, providing the visual system with information about a rapidly changing world in advance of the generation of a more elaborate and stable perceptual representation.},

This coding could be provided by the ratios of cone-photoreceptor excitations produced by light from different surfaces: for a large class of pigmented surfaces and for surfaces with random spectral reflectances, these ratios are statistically almost invariant under changes in illumination by light from the sun and sky or from a planckian radiator.

Stable inferences about surface color might be supported by spatial ratios of cone excitations from the reflected light, but their invariance has been quantified only for global changes in illuminant spectrum. The aim here was to test their invariance under natural changes in both illumination spectrum and geometry, especially in the distribution of shadows. Time-lapse hyperspectral radiance images were acquired from five outdoor vegetated and nonvegetated scenes. From each scene, 10,000 pairs of points were sampled randomly and ratios measured across time. Mean relative deviations in ratios were generally large, but when sampling was limited to short distances or moderate time intervals, they fell below the level for detecting violations in ratio invariance. When illumination changes with uneven geometry were excluded, they fell further, to levels obtained with global changes in illuminant spectrum alone. Within sampling constraints, ratios of cone excitations, and also of opponent-color combinations, provide an approximately invariant signal for stable surface-color inferences, despite spectral and geometric variations in scene illumination.},

In computational simulations with images of vegetated and nonvegetated outdoor scenes, it is shown that color provides an unreliable guide to surface identity. It is also shown that changes in illuminant may cause colors to no longer match and the relations between individual colors to vary. These failures are generally well described by a measure of the randomness of the colors in scenes, the Shannon entropy. Although uncertainty is intrinsic to the environment, its consequences for color vision can be predicted.},

  abstract = {Categorical perception (CP) of color is the faster and more accurate discrimination of two colors from different categories than two colors from the same category, even when same- and different-category chromatic separations are equated. In adults, color CP is lateralized to the left hemisphere (LH), whereas in infants, it is lateralized to the right hemisphere (RH). There is evidence that the LH bias in color CP in adults is due to the influence of color terms in the LH. Here we show that the RH to LH switch in color CP occurs when the words that distinguish the relevant category boundary are learned. A colored target was shown in either the left- or right-visual field on either the same- or different-category background, with equal hue separation for both conditions. The time to initiate an eye movement toward the target from central fixation at target onset was recorded. Color naming and comprehension was assessed. Toddlers were faster at detecting targets on different- than same-category backgrounds and the extent of CP did not vary with level of color term knowledge. However, for toddlers who knew the relevant color terms, the category effect was found only for targets in the RVF (LH), whereas for toddlers learning the color terms, the category effect was found only for targets in the LVF (RH). The findings suggest that lateralization of color CP changes with color term acquisition, and provide evidence for the influence of language on the functional organization of the brain.},

  abstract = {Infants respond categorically to color. However, the nature of infants' categorical responding to color is unclear. The current study investigated two issues. First, is infants' categorical responding more absolute than adults' categorical responding? That is, can infants discriminate two stimuli from the same color category? Second, is color categorization in infants truly perceptual? Color categorization was tested by recording adults' and infants' eye movements on a target detection task. In Experiment 1, adults were faster at fixating a colored target when it was presented on a colored background from a different color category (between-category) than when it was presented on a colored background from the same color category (within-category), even when within- and between-category chromatic differences were equated in CIE (Committee International d'\'Eclairage) color space. This category effect was found for two chromatic separation sizes. In Experiment 2, 4-month-olds also responded categorically on the task. Infants were able to fixate the target when the background color was from the same category. However, as with adults, infants were faster at fixating the target when the target background chromatic difference was between-category than when it was within-category. This implies that infant color categorization, like adult color categorization, is truly perceptual.},

Here, we replicated this important study and extended it to include secondary boundaries, with a crucial modification: The separations between habituated and novel stimuli were equated in a perceptually uniform metric (Munsell), rather than in wavelength. Experiment 1 found Categorical Perception and no within-category novelty preference for primary boundary blue-green and secondary boundary blue-purple. Experiment 2 replicated the categorical effect for blue-purple and found no within-category novelty preference with increased stimulus separation. Experiment 3 showed category effects for a lightness/saturation boundary, pink-red. Novelty preference requires a categorical difference between the habituated and novel stimulus.

Categorical decisions can be used to study decision making more generally by dissociating category identity of stimuli from the actions subjects use to signal their decisions. Here we discuss the evidence for such abstract categorical encoding in the primate brain and consider the relationship with other perceptual decision paradigms. Recent work on visual categorization has examined neuronal activity across a hierarchically organized network of cortical areas in monkeys trained to group visual stimuli into arbitrary categories. This has revealed a transformation of visual-feature encoding in early visual cortical areas into more flexible categorical representations in downstream parietal and prefrontal areas. These neuronal category representations are encoded as abstract internal cognitive states because they are not rigidly linked with either specific sensory stimuli or the actions that the monkeys use to signal their categorical choices.},

  abstract = {Psychophysical studies indicate that perception of the colour and brightness of a surface depends on neural signals evoked by the borders of the surface rather than its interior. The visual cortex emphasizes contrast borders, but it is unclear whether colour surface signals also exist, whether colour border signals are orientation selective or mainly non-oriented, and whether cortical processing tends to separate colour and form information. To address these questions we examined the representation of uniform colour figures by recording single neuron activity from areas V1 and V2 in alert macaque monkeys during behaviourally induced fixation. Three aspects of coding were quantified: colour, orientation and edge selectivity. The occurrence of colour selectivity was not correlated with orientation or edge selectivity. The fraction of colour-selective cells was the same (64 \% in layers 2 and 3 of V1, 45 \% in V2) for oriented and non-oriented cells, and for edge-selective and surface-responsive cells. Oriented cells were often highly selective in colour space, and about 40 \% of them were selective for edge polarity or border ownership. Thus, contrary to the idea of feature maps, colour, orientation and edge polarity are multiplexed in cortical signals. The results from V2 were similar to those from upper-layer V1, indicating that cortical processing does not strive to separate form and colour information. Oriented cells were five times more frequent than non-oriented cells. Thus, the vast majority of colour-coded cells are orientation tuned. Based on response profiles across a 4 deg square figure, and the relative frequency of oriented and non-oriented cells, we estimate that the cortical colour signal is 5?6 times stronger for the edges than for the surface of the figure. The frequency of oriented colour cells and their ability to code edge polarity indicate that these cells play a major role in the representation of surface colour.},

The behaviour examined was the avoidance of collision with another pedestrian or an obstacle, and the facial recognition distance and the interpersonal distance required to feel comfortably secure. A pilot experiment was set up, in which the behaviour of ten participants was tested under illuminance of 0.67, 2.8, 5.5, 12.3 and 627 lux. Results showed that only facial recognition distance has a proportionate relationship to the illuminance levels. It was also found that in order to provide facial recognition when a pedestrian starts a collision avoidance manoeuvre, more illuminance than today's lighting standard is necessary. It is suggested to reconsider what tasks are necessary for pedestrians at nighttime, and that the illuminance level of each street should be based on assumed tasks undertaken by pedestrians, rather than car traffic, on each street.},

  abstract = {Color constancy can be achieved by analyzing the chromatic aberration in an image. Chromatic aberration spatially separates light of different wavelengths and this allows the spectral power distribution of the light to be extracted. This is more information about the light than is registered by the cones of the human visual system or by a color television camera; and, using it, we show how color constancy, the separation of reflectance from illumination, can be achieved. As examples, we consider grey-level images of (a) a colored dot under unknown illumination, and (b) an edge between two differently colored regions under unknown illumination. Our first result is that in principle we can determine completely the spectral power distribution of the reflected light from the dot or, in the case of the color edge, the difference in the spectral power distributions of the light from the two regions. By employing a finite-dimensional linear model of illumination and surface reflectance, we obtain our second result, which is that the spectrum of the reflected light can be uniquely decomposed into a component due to the illuminant and another component due to the surface reflectance. This decomposition provides the complete spectral reflectance function, and hence color, of the surface as well as the spectral power distribution of the illuminant. Up to the limit of the accuracy of the finite-dimensional model, this effectively solves the color constancy problem.},

In this situation, the color of one or both surfaces can be modified by a color-bleeding effect. In this article we examine how sensor values (e.g., RGB values) are modified in the mutual reflection region and show that a good approximation of the surface spectral reflectance function for each surface can be recovered by using the extra information from mutual reflection. Thus color constancy results from an examination of mutual reflection. Use is made of finite dimensional linear models for ambient illumination and for surface spectral reflectance. If m and n are the number of basis functions required to model illumination and surface spectral reflectance respectively, then we find that the number of different sensor classes p must satisfy the condition p{$\geq$}(2 n+m)/3. If we use three basis functions to model illumination and three basis functions to model surface spectral reflectance, then only three classes of sensors are required to carry out the algorithm. Results are presented showing a small increase in error over the error inherent in the underlying finite dimension models.},

This result has surprised us since we have previously used the better of these algorithms successfully to correct the colour balance of images for display. Colour balancing has been the typical application of colour constancy, rarely has it been actually put to use in a computer vision system, so our goal was to show how well the various methods would do on an obvious machine colour vision task, namely, object recognition. Although all the colour constancy methods we tested proved insufficient for the task, we consider this an important finding in itself. In addition we present results showing the correlation between colour constancy performance and object recognition performance, and as one might expect, the better the colour constancy the better the recognition rate.},

  abstract = {The poor performance of the MaxRGB illuminationestimation method is often used in the literature as a foil when promoting some new illumination-estimation method. However, the results presented here show that in fact MaxRGB works surprisingly well when tested on a new dataset of 105 high dynamic range images, and also better than previously reported when some simple pre-processing is applied to the images of the standard 321 image set [1]. The HDR images in the dataset for color constancy research were constructed in the standard way from multiple exposures of the same scene. The color of the scene illumination was determined by photographing an extra HDR image of the scene with 4 Gretag Macbeth mini Colorcheckers at 45 degrees relative to one another placed in it. With preprocessing, MaxRGB's performance is statistically equivalent to that of Color by Correlation [2] and statistically superior to that of the Greyedge [3] algorithm on the 321 set (null hypothesis rejected at the 5\% significance level). It also performs as well as Greyedge on the HDR set. These results demonstrate that MaxRGB is far more effective than it has been reputed to be so long as it is applied to image data that encodes the full dynamic range of the original scene.},

  abstract = {Much of what we know about how our sensory systems operate comes from studying aftereffects. Prolonged and repeated exposure to a constant stimulus (adaptation) can impact responses to subsequent test stimuli, compared to a non-adapted test stimulus. Researchers often infer, based on changes to response patterns, that sensory encoding has been changed by adaptation. However, it can be ambiguous whether a given aftereffect changes sensory encoding, decision processes, or both. We propose that confidence estimates can be used as a diagnostic tool to identify whether aftereffects arise either partially or entirely from post-perceptual processes. In three experiments, we demonstrate the utility of confidence judgements in determining whether an aftereffect results from sensory or criterion changes. Given the simplicity of our approach, this tool could readily be applied to resolve contemporary controversies regarding the origins of aftereffects and the penetration of perception by cognition.},

  abstract = {Deep neural networks (DNNs) are known for extracting good representations from a large amount of data. However, the representations learned in DNNs are typically hard to interpret, especially the ones learned in dense layers. One crucial issue is that neurons within each layer of DNNs are conditionally independent with each other, which makes the co-training and analysis of neurons at higher modularity difficult. In contrast, the dependency patterns of biological neurons in the human brain are largely different from those of DNNs. Neuronal assembly describes such neuron dependencies that could be found among a group of biological neurons as having strong internal synaptic interactions, potentially high semantical correlations that are deemed to facilitate the memorization process. In this paper, we show such a crucial gap between DNNs and biological neural networks (BNNs) can be bridged by the newly proposed Biologically-Enhanced Artificial Neuronal assembly (BEAN) regularization that could enforce dependencies among neurons in dense layers of DNNs without altering the conventional architecture. Both qualitative and quantitative analyses show that BEAN enables the formations of interpretable and biologically plausible neuronal assemblies in dense layers and consequently enhances the modularity and interpretability of the hidden representations learned. Moreover, BEAN further results in sparse and structured connectivity and parameter sharing among neurons, which substantially improves the efficiency and generalizability of the model.},

In this work we propose a new color constancy model by imitating the functional properties of the HVS from the single-opponent (SO) cells in the retina to the DO cells in V1 and the possible neurons in the higher visual cortexes. The idea behind the proposed double-opponency based color constancy (DOCC) model originates from the substantial observation that the color distribution of the responses of DO cells to the color-biased images coincides well with the vector denoting the light source color. Then the illuminant color is easily estimated by pooling the responses of DO cells in separate channels in LMS space with the pooling mechanism of sum or max. Extensive evaluations on three commonly used datasets, including the test with the dataset dependent optimal parameters, as well as the intraand inter-dataset cross validation, show that our physiologically inspired DOCC model can produce quite competitive results in comparison to the state-of-the-art approaches, but with a relative simple implementation and without requiring fine-tuning of the method for each different dataset.},

In this paper we propose a computational model which imitates the neural mechanisms of color information processing in retina. In this model we first compute a simple statistics of reflectance about the real scene by simulating bipolar cells. Then, the ganglion cells (e.g., the midget cells) receive both the computational statistics of reflectance of the scene from bipolar cells and the response from horizontal cells as well as amacrine cells. Subsequently, the ganglion cells provide a stable output independent of the color of illuminant. We tested our model on a commonly used large-scale linear image dataset, and the results demonstrate that our model provides better color constancy performance than those widely accepted color constancy models.},

During the experiment a randomly assigned colour patch, of controlled luminance, was displayed through the 4\textdegree{} aperture in the centre of the visual field, whilst the surround was lit through the top aperture with narrowband illumination. The observer's task was to adjust the colour patch to an achromatic appearance by moving handheld sliders, one controlling the blueness/yellowness of the patch, and another controlling the redness/greenness. This was repeated for 16 luminance levels, decrementing in steps of 5 L* from 85 to 10. This process was repeated 10 times, forming a one hour session, to allow an observation of adaptation over time. 16 sessions per observer were performed, with a different wavelength of narrowband light illuminating the sphere interior (visual surround) for each session, covering the wavelengths 400nm-700nm inclusive in 20nm intervals. The interior of the sphere was painted matt grey to make the surround as homogenous as possible. Initial observations on data collected using this setup, from two observers, were presented by MacDonald and Roque (2013).

The observer was required to select an achromatic point within each stimulus, and from their selection an estimation of their state of chromatic adaptation was acquired.{$<$}br{$>$} Aside from being suitable for real world environments, the technique may also be valuable as a method for assessing colour constancy quickly in large numbers of members of the public and, also due to the simplicity of the task and the familiarity of the apparatus, it allows for a broader demographic range of observers than are generally available for such experiments. At AIC 2016 preliminary data was presented (Garside et. al, AIC 2016) based on experiments in the Grant Museum of Zoology where this technique was originally trialled, with the aim of understanding inherent observer variability, and deciding upon a recommended number of repeats for such an experiment. The derived number of repeats was 30, but it was decided that an environment with more constant and controlled lighting was required to more fully understand inter-observer variability. Here, two new data sets will be considered; the first collected at various locations within the British Museum, with the aim of more comprehensively exploring inter-observer variability; and the second collected in the controlled environment of the PAMELA research laboratory at UCL, where the acuity of this system, and inter-observer variability was explored.},

  abstract = {Museums seek a pragmatic compromise between lighting which causes minimal damage to objects and lighting which allows maximal visitor enjoyment. One way to reduce damage is to choose illumination of a lower Correlated Colour Temperature (CCT), since this contains less short-wavelength radiation, which is generally more damaging. Colour appearance models suggest that a change in CCT alone should not affect visual experience, but there is a long history of studies which aim to find a `preferred' CCT for museum environments. These experiments have often had conflicting findings. One potential cause for this would be if the spectral sensitivity for adaptation differed from the spectral sensitivity for vision, as generally only the chromaticity (not the spectrum) is controlled in such experiments. Such a situation might arise if the recently discovered intrinsically photosensitive Retinal Ganglion Cells (ipRGCs), which express melanopsin, were involved in colour constancy. Two psychophysical experiments were performed whereby observers were adapted to different spectra whilst performing an achromatic matching task. The first experiment used sixteen narrow-band light sources as adapting fields, and the second used two perceptually indistinguishable sources which differed in melanopic power. Neither experiment found evidence for a role of melanopsin in colour constancy, but it was noted that the model of colour constancy implicitly under examination was under-developed and did not produce clear predictions. Regarding this, an exploratory computational study was performed, to explore whether, and in what way, a melanopsin signal might contribute to an observer's ability to achieve colour constancy. It was found that a normalised melanopic signal provided a means by which colour constancy could be roughly achieved, without the need for scene-level regularities which other algorithms rely upon. Additionally, a novel method for performing colour constancy experiments upon a tablet computer was developed, so that experiments could be run more easily within real world environments.},

  abstract = {The representation of the visual field in areas V3 and V4 of the macaque was mapped with multiunit electrodes. Twelve Macaca fascicularis were studied in repeated recording sessions while immobilized and anesthetized. V3 is a narrow strip (4\textendash 5 mm wide) of myeloarchitectonically distinct cortex located immediately anterior to V2. It contains a systematic representation of the central 35\textendash 40 degrees of the contralateral visual field; the representation of the upper quadrant is located ventrally in the hemisphere and that of the lower quadrant, dorsally. There is a small gap between the dorsal (V3d) and ventral (V3v) portions of V3. The representation of the horizontal meridian is adjacent to that in V2 and forms the posterior border of both V3d and V3v. Most or all of the anterior border of V3d consists of the representation of the lower vertical meridian. The entire anterior border of V3v consists of the representation of the upper vertical meridian. V4 is a strip of myeloarchitectonically distinct cortex 5\textendash 8 mm wide, immediately anterior to V3. It contains a coarse, but systematic, representation of approximately the central 35\textendash 40 degrees of the contralateral visual field. The representation of the upper visual field is located ventrally in the hemisphere. Most of the representation of the lower visual field is located dorsally. The posterior border of V4 corresponds to the representation of the vertical meridian, and the representation of the horizontal meridian is located at or near its anterior border. In both V3 and V4, the representation of the central visual field is magnified relative to that of the periphery. In both areas, the size of receptive fields increases with increasing eccentricity; however, at a given eccentricity, the receptive fields of V4 are larger than those of V3.},

We investigated the functional properties of neurons in extrastriate area V3. V3 receives inputs from both magno- and parvocellular pathways and has prominent projections to both the middle temporal area (area MT) and V4. It may therefore represent an important site for integration and transformation of visual signals. We recorded the activity of single units representing the central 10\textdegree{} in anesthetized, paralyzed macaque monkeys. We measured each cell's spatial, temporal, chromatic, and motion properties with the use of a variety of stimuli. Results were compared with measurements made in V2 neurons at similar eccentricities. Similar to area V2, most of the neurons in our sample (80\%) were orientation selective, and the distribution of orientation bandwidths was similar to that found in V2. Neurons in V3 preferred lower spatial and higher temporal frequencies than V2 neurons. Contrast thresholds of V3 neurons were extremely low. Achromatic contrast sensitivity was much higher than in V2, and similar to that found in MT. About 40\% of all neurons showed strong directional selectivity. We did not find strongly directional cells in layer 4 of V3, the layer in which the bulk of V1 and V2 inputs terminate. This property seems to be developed within area V3. An analysis of the responses of directionally selective cells to plaid patterns showed that in area V3, as in MT and unlike in V1 and V2, there exist cells sensitive to the motion of the plaid pattern rather than to that of the components. The exact proportion of cells classified as being selective to color depended to a large degree on the experiment and on the criteria used for classification. With the use of the same conditions as in a previous study of V2 cells, we found as many (54\%) color-selective cells as in V2 (50\%). Furthermore, the responses of V3 cells to colored sinusoidal gratings were well described by a linear combination of cone inputs. The two subpopulations of cells responsive to color and to motion overlapped to a large extent, and we found a significant proportion of cells that gave reliable and directional responses to drifting isoluminant gratings. Our results show that there is a significant interaction between color and motion processing in area V3, and that V3 cells exhibit the more complex motion properties typically observed at later stages of visual processing.},

In this paper we follow a line of research that assumes uniform illumination of a scene, and that the principal step in estimating reflectances is the estimation of the scene illuminant. We review recent approaches to illuminant estimation, firstly those based on formulae for normalisation of the reflectance distribution in an image - so-called grey-world algorithms, and those based on a Bayesian formulation of image formation. In evaluating these previous approaches we introduce a new tool in the form of a database of 568 high-quality, indoor and outdoor images, accurately labelled with illuminant, and preserved in their raw form, free of correction or normalisation. This has enabled us to establish several properties experimentally. Firstly automatic selection of grey-world algorithms according to image properties is not nearly so effective as has been thought. Secondly, it is shown that Bayesian illuminant estimation is significantly improved by the improved accuracy of priors for illuminant and reflectance that are obtained from the new dataset.},

This edition has been revised to keep abreast of current research in microclimatology, to provide more examples of work from North America, and to more clearly illustrate how surface energy fluxes are linked to the nature of the surface environment. The authors have added discussions dealing with the speed of sound, the use of vegetative barriers to reduce sound, and physiological control of energy and moisture exchanges. They have also expanded the discussion of microclimatic effects on animal and human behavior and dwellings.

Studies comparing the functional selectivities of neurons within the early visual areas have found that there are more similar than different between the areas. We simultaneously imaged visually evoked activation over regions of V2 and V4 and parametrically varied three visual attributes for which selectivity exists in both areas: color, orientation, and size. We found that color selective regions were observed in both areas and were of similar size and spatial distribution. However, two major areal distinctions were observed: V4 contained a greater number and diversity of color-specific regions than V2 and exhibited a higher degree of overlap between domains for different functional attributes. In V2, size and color regions were largely segregated from orientation domains, whereas in V4 both color and size regions overlapped considerably with orientation regions. Our results suggest that higher-order composite selectivities in the extrastriate cortex may arise organically from the interactions afforded by an overlap of functional domains for lower order selectivities.},

We analyzed results of the World Color Survey (WCS) of 110 languages to show that despite gross differences across languages, communication of chromatic chips is always better for warm colors (yellows/reds) than cool colors (blues/greens). We present an analysis of color statistics in a large databank of natural images curated by human observers for salient objects and show that objects tend to have warm rather than cool colors. These results suggest that the cross-linguistic similarity in color-naming efficiency reflects colors of universal usefulness and provide an account of a principle (color use) that governs how color categories come about. We show that potential methodological issues with the WCS do not corrupt information-theoretic analyses, by collecting original data using two extreme versions of the color-naming task, in three groups: the Tsimane', a remote Amazonian hunter-gatherer isolate; Bolivian-Spanish speakers; and English speakers. These data also enabled us to test another prediction of the color-usefulness hypothesis: that differences in color categorization between languages are caused by differences in overall usefulness of color to a culture. In support, we found that color naming among Tsimane' had relatively low communicative efficiency, and the Tsimane' were less likely to use color terms when describing familiar objects. Color-naming among Tsimane' was boosted when naming artificially colored objects compared with natural objects, suggesting that industrialization promotes color usefulness.},

As a consequence, no algorithm can be considered as universal. However, with the large variety of available methods, the question is how to select the method that induces equivalent classes for different image characteristics. Furthermore, the subsequent question is how to combine the different algorithms in a proper way. To achieve selection and combining of color constancy algorithms, in this paper, natural image statistics are used to identify the most important characteristics of color images. Then, based on these image characteristics, the proper color constancy algorithm (or best combination of algorithms) is selected for a specific image. To capture the image characteristics, the Weibull parameterization (e.g. texture and contrast) is used. Experiments show that, on a large data set of 11,000 images, our approach outperforms current state-of-the-art single algorithms, as well as simple alternatives for combining several algorithms.},

  abstract = {Color constancy algorithms are generally based on the simplifying assumption that the spectral distribution of a light source is uniform across scenes. However, in reality, this assumption is often violated due to the presence of multiple light sources. In this paper, we will address more realistic scenarios where the uniform light-source assumption is too restrictive. First, a methodology is proposed to extend existing algorithms by applying color constancy locally to image patches, rather than globally to the entire image. After local (patch-based) illuminant estimation, these estimates are combined into more robust estimations, and a local correction is applied based on a modified diagonal model. Quantitative and qualitative experiments on spectral and real images show that the proposed methodology reduces the influence of two light sources simultaneously present in one scene. If the chromatic difference between these two illuminants is more than 1\textdegree, the proposed framework outperforms algorithms based on the uniform light-source assumption (with error-reduction up to approximately 30\%). Otherwise, when the chromatic difference is less than 1\textdegree and the scene can be considered to contain one (approximately) uniform light source, the performance of the proposed method framework is similar to global color constancy methods.},

Several criteria are proposed that are used to assess the approaches. A taxonomy of existing algorithms is proposed and methods are separated in three groups: static methods, gamut-based methods and learning-based methods. Further, the experimental setup is discussed including an overview of publicly available data sets.

However, it is unknown whether these distance measures correlate to human vision. Therefore, the main goal of our paper is to analyze the correlation between several performance measures and the quality, obtained by using psychophysical experiments, of the output images generated by various color constancy algorithms. Subsequent issues that are addressed are the distribution of performance measures, suggesting additional and alternative information that can be provided to summarize the performance over a large set of images, and the perceptual significance of obtained improvements, i.e., the improvement that should be obtained before the difference becomes noticeable to a human observer.},

Nevertheless, these models fail on 2 important counts: They contain no anchoring rule, and they fail to account for the pattern of errors in surface lightness. Recent work on both the anchoring problem and the problem of errors has produced a new model of lightness perception, one that is qualitatively different from the intrinsic image models. The new model, which is based on a combination of local and global anchoring of lightness values, appears to provide an unprecedented account of a wide range of empirical results, both classical and recent, especially the pattern of errors. It provides a unified account of both illumination-dependent failures of constancy and background-dependent failures of constancy, resolving a number of long-standing puzzles.},

However, the neural substrata involved in those mechanisms remain to be elucidated. Our study analyzed links between psychophysical measurements and retinal physiological evidence with consideration for the phenomena of rod-cone interactions, photon noise, and spatial summation. Threshold test luminances were obtained with steady background fields at mesopic and photopic light levels (i.e., 0.06\textendash 110cd/m2) for retinal eccentricities from 0\textdegree{} to 15\textdegree{} using three combinations of background/test field sizes (i.e., 10\textdegree/2\textdegree, 10\textdegree/0.45\textdegree, and 1\textdegree/0.45\textdegree ). A two-channel Maxwellian view optical system was employed to eliminate pupil effects on the measured thresholds. A model based on visual mechanisms that were described in the literature was optimized to fit the measured luminance thresholds in all experimental conditions. Our results can be described by a combination of visual mechanisms. We determined how spatial summation changed with eccentricity and how subtractive adaptation changed with eccentricity and background field size. According to our model, photon noise plays a significant role to explain contrast detection thresholds measured with the 1/0.45\textdegree{} background/test size combination at mesopic luminances and at off-axis eccentricities. In these conditions, our data reflect the presence of rod-cone interaction for eccentricities between 6\textdegree{} and 9\textdegree{} and luminances between 0.6 and 5cd/m2. In spite of the increasing noise effects with eccentricity, results also show that the visual system tends to maintain a constant signal-to-noise ratio in the off-axis detection task over the whole mesopic range.},

  abstract = {Human visual cortex is partitioned into different functional areas that, from lower to higher, become increasingly selective and responsive to complex feature dimensions. Here we use a Representational Similarity Analysis (RSA) of fMRI-BOLD signals to make quantitative comparisons across LGN and multiple visual areas of the low-level stimulus information encoded in the patterns of voxel responses. Our stimulus set was picked to target the four functionally distinct subcortical channels that input visual cortex from the LGN: two achromatic sinewave stimuli that favor the responses of the high-temporal magnocellular and high-spatial parvocellular pathways, respectively, and two chromatic stimuli isolating the L/M-cone opponent and S-cone opponent pathways, respectively. Each stimulus type had three spatial extents to sample both foveal and para-central visual field. With the RSA, we compare quantitatively the response specializations for individual stimuli and combinations of stimuli in each area and how these change across visual cortex. First, our results replicate the known response preferences for motion/flicker in the dorsal visual areas. In addition, we identify two distinct gradients along the ventral visual stream. In the early visual areas (V1\textendash V3), the strongest differential representation is for the achromatic high spatial frequency stimuli, suitable for form vision, and a very weak differentiation of chromatic versus achromatic contrast. Emerging in ventral occipital areas (V4, VO1 and VO2), however, is an increasingly strong separation of the responses to chromatic versus achromatic contrast and a decline in the high spatial frequency representation. These gradients provide new insight into how visual information is transformed across the visual cortex.},

  abstract = {In numerous studies on colour constancy or colour induction subjects have to adjust a test field so that it looks achromatic. Their viewing behaviour during these settings is often not controlled or reported. Here I show that the results of grey settings depend on whether subjects visually explore the stimulus by looking around or fixate their gaze exclusively on the test field. Two different viewing instructions are compared with regard to the degree of constancy as measured by the shift of grey settings in coloured surrounds. In variegated surrounds (but not in uniform surrounds) there is a robust effect of viewing condition for all subjects and all surround chromaticities tested, in that exploration increases colour constancy compared to fixating the test field. Values of a colour constancy index are increased by as much as 20\% (where 100\% colour constancy means that the subject chooses as grey the mean chromaticity of the surround) with an average across all subjects and surrounds of 12.6\%. Thus, if this factor is not experimentally controlled, it could inflate variance, reduce comparability between different studies, and even lead to unwarranted conclusions if viewing behaviour unpredictably differs between experimental conditions.},

The same is true for the excitations of the photoreceptors, which serve as the basis for the perceived colour. However, our visual system has the ability to perceive constant surface colours despite changes in illumination1. The average chromaticity of the retinal image of a scene depends on the illumination, and thus might be used by the visual system to estimate the illumination and to modulate the correction that subserves colour constancy2,3,4. But this measure is not sufficient: a reddish scene under white light can produce the same mean stimulation as a neutral scene in red light. Higher order scene statistics\textemdash for example, the correlation between redness and luminance within the image\textemdash allow these cases to be distinguished. Here we report that the human visual system does exploit such a statistic when estimating the illuminant, and gives it a weight that is statistically appropriate for the natural environment.},

  abstract = {Absorbance spectra were recorded by microspectrophotometry from 39 different rod and cone types representing amphibians, reptiles, and fishes, with A1- or A2-based visual pigments and {$\lambda$}max ranging from 357 to 620 nm. The purpose was to investigate accuracy limits of putative universal templates for visual pigment absorbance spectra, and if possible to amend the templates to overcome the limitations. It was found that (1) the absorbance spectrum of frog rhodopsin extract very precisely parallels that of rod outer segments from the same individual, with only a slight hypsochromic shift in {$\lambda$}max, hence templates based on extracts are valid for absorbance in situ; (2) a template based on the bovine rhodopsin extract data of Partridge and De Grip (1991) describes the absorbance of amphibian rod outer segments excellently, contrary to recent electrophysiological results; (3) the {$\lambda$}max/{$\lambda$} invariance of spectral shape fails for A1 pigments with small {$\lambda$}max and for A2 pigments with large {$\lambda$}max, but the deviations are systematic and can be readily incorporated into, for example, the Lamb (1995) template. We thus propose modified templates for the main ``{$\alpha$}-band'' of A1 and A2 pigments and show that these describe both absorbance and spectral sensitivities of photoreceptors over the whole range of {$\lambda$}max. Subtraction of the {$\alpha$}-band from the full absorbance spectrum leaves a ``{$\beta$}-band'' described by a {$\lambda$}max-dependent Gaussian. We conclude that the idea of universal templates (one for A1- and one for A2-based visual pigments) remains valid and useful at the present level of accuracy of data on photoreceptor absorbance and sensitivity. The sum of our expressions for the {$\alpha$}- and {$\beta$}-band gives a good description for visual pigment spectra with {$\lambda$}max {$>$} 350 nm.},

  abstract = {Perceptual learning involves an improvement in perceptual judgment with practice, which is often specific to stimulus or task factors. Perceptual learning has been shown on a range of visual tasks but very little research has explored chromatic perceptual learning. Here, we use two low level perceptual threshold tasks and a supra-threshold target detection task to assess chromatic perceptual learning and category effects. Experiment 1 investigates whether chromatic thresholds reduce as a result of training and at what level of analysis learning effects occur. Experiment 2 explores the effect of category training on chromatic thresholds, whether training of this nature is category specific and whether it can induce categorical responding. Experiment 3 investigates the effect of category training on a higher level, lateralized target detection task, previously found to be sensitive to category effects. The findings indicate that performance on a perceptual threshold task improves following training but improvements do not transfer across retinal location or hue. Therefore, chromatic perceptual learning is category specific and can occur at relatively early stages of visual analysis. Additionally, category training does not induce category effects on a low level perceptual threshold task, as indicated by comparable discrimination thresholds at the newly learned hue boundary and adjacent test points. However, category training does induce category effects on a supra-threshold target detection task. Whilst chromatic perceptual learning is possible, learnt category effects appear to be a product of left hemisphere processing, and may require the input of higher level linguistic coding processes in order to manifest.},

It is a real vector space, but no matter what inner product you put on the space the resulting Euclidean distance does not correspond to human perception of difference between colours. In 1942 MacAdam performed the first experiments on colour matching and found the MacAdam ellipses which are often interpreted as defining the metric tensor at their centres. An important question is whether it is possible to define colour coordinates such that the Euclidean distance in these coordinates correspond to human perception. Using cubic splines to represent the colour coordinates and an optimisation approach we find new colour coordinates that make the MacAdam ellipses closer to uniform circles than the existing standards.},

In certain subjects, parafoveal cones were classified as L, M, or S, which permitted the comparison of unique yellow measurements with variations in local L/M ratios within and between observers. Unique yellow shifted to longer wavelengths as stimulus size or duration was reduced. This effect is most pronounced for changes in size and more apparent in the fovea than in the parafovea. The observed variations in unique yellow are not entirely predicted from variations in L/M ratio and therefore implicate neural processes beyond photoreception.},

Data on the colour categories of English speakers was collected using online crowd sourcing \textendash{} 1,000 subjects produced 20,000 unconstrained names for 600 colour stimuli. From this data, using the framework of Information Geometry, a Riemannian metric was computed throughout the RGB cube. This is the first colour metric to have been computed from colour categorization data. In this categorical metric the distance between two close colours is determined by the difference in the distribution of names that the subject population applied to them. This contrasts with previous colour metrics which have been driven by stimulus discriminability, or acceptability of a colour match. The categorical metric is analysed and shown to be clearly different from discriminability-based metrics. Natural units of categorical length, area and volume are derived. These allow a count to be made of the number of categorically-distinct regions of categorically-similar colours that fit within colour space. Our analysis estimates that 27 such regions fit within the RGB cube, which agrees well with a previous estimate of 30 colours that can be identified by name by untrained subjects.},

  abstract = {To generate behavioral responses based on sensory input, motor areas of the brain must interpret, or ``read out,'' signals from sensory maps. Our experiments tested several algorithms for how the motor systems for smooth pursuit and saccadic eye movements might extract a usable signal of target velocity from the distributed representation of velocity in the middle temporal visual area (MT or V5). Using microstimulation, we attempted to manipulate the velocity information within MT while monkeys tracked a moving visual stimulus. We examined the effects of the microstimulation on smooth pursuit and on the compensation for target velocity shown by saccadic eye movements. Microstimulation could alter both the speed and direction of the motion estimates of both types of eye movements and could also cause monkeys to generate pursuit even when the visual target was actually stationary. The pattern of alterations suggests that microstimulation can introduce an additional velocity signal into MT and that the pursuit and saccadic systems usually compute a vector average of the visually evoked and microstimulation-induced velocity signals (pursuit, 55 of 122 experiments; saccades, 70 of 122). Microstimulation effects in a few experiments were consistent with vector summation of these two signals (pursuit, 6 of 122; saccades, 2 of 122). In the remainder of the experiments, microstimulation caused either an apparent impairment in motion processing (pursuit, 47 of 122; saccades, 41 of 122) or had no effect (pursuit, 14 of 122; saccades, 9 of 122). Within individual experiments, the effects on pursuit and saccades were usually similar, but the occasional striking exception suggests that the two eye movement systems may perform motion computations somewhat independently.},

  abstract = {Two morphological types of melanopsin-expressing ganglion cells have been described in primate retina. Both types show intrinsic light responses as well as rod- and cone-driven ON-type responses. Outer stratifying cells have their dendrites close to the inner nuclear layer (OFF sublamina); inner stratifying cells have their dendrites close to the ganglion cell layer (ON sublamina). Both inner and outer stratifying cells receive synaptic input via ribbon synapses, but the bipolar cell types providing this input have not been identified. Here, we addressed the question whether the diffuse (ON) cone bipolar type DB6 and/or rod bipolar cells contact melanopsin-expressing ganglion cells. Melanopsin containing ganglion cells in marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) and macaque (Macaca fascicularis) retinas were identified immunohistochemically; DB6 cells were labeled with antibodies against the carbohydrate epitope CD15, rod bipolar cells were labeled with antibodies against protein kinase C, and putative synapses between the two cells types were identified with antibodies against piccolo. For one inner cell, nearly all of the DB6 axon terminals that overlap with its dendrites in the two-dimensional space show areas of close contact. In vertical sections, the large majority of the areas of close contact also contain a synaptic punctum, suggesting that DB6 cells contact inner melanopsin cells. The output from DB6 cells accounts for about 30\% of synapses onto inner melanopsin cells. Synaptic contacts between rod bipolar axons and inner dendrites were not observed. In the OFF sublamina, about 10\% of the DB6 axons are closely associated with dendrites of outer cells, and in about a third of these areas, axonal en passant synapses are detected. This result suggests that DB6 cells may also provide input to outer melanopsin cells.},

  abstract = {This review summarizes our current knowledge of primate including human retina focusing on bipolar, amacrine and ganglion cells and their connectivity. We have two main motivations in writing. Firstly, recent progress in non-invasive imaging methods to study retinal diseases mean that better understanding of the primate retina is becoming an important goal both for basic and for clinical sciences. Secondly, genetically modified mice are increasingly used as animal models for human retinal diseases. Thus, it is important to understand to which extent the retinas of primates and rodents are comparable. We first compare cell populations in primate and rodent retinas, with emphasis on how the fovea (despite its small size) dominates the neural landscape of primate retina. We next summarise what is known, and what is not known, about the postreceptoral neurone populations in primate retina. The inventories of bipolar and ganglion cells in primates are now nearing completion, comprising \textasciitilde 12 types of bipolar cell and at least 17 types of ganglion cell. Primate ganglion cells show clear differences in dendritic field size across the retina, and their morphology differs clearly from that of mouse retinal ganglion cells. Compared to bipolar and ganglion cells, amacrine cells show even higher morphological diversity: they could comprise over 40 types. Many amacrine types appear conserved between primates and mice, but functions of only a few types are understood in any primate or non-primate retina. Amacrine cells appear as the final frontier for retinal research in monkeys and mice alike.},

Li et al (2013) recently found that transfer of form-meaning connections from a concrete domain (height) to an abstract domain (power) was achieved in a metaphor-consistent way without awareness, showing that unconscious knowledge can be abstract and flexibly deployed. The current study aims to determine whether people transfer knowledge of form-meaning connections not only from a concrete domain to an abstract one, but also vice versa, consistent with metaphor representation being bi-directional. With a similar paradigm as used by Li et al, participants learnt form- meaning connections of different domains (concrete vs. abstract) and then were tested on two kinds of generalizations (same and different domain generalization). As predicted, transfer of form-meaning connections occurred bidirectionally when structural knowledge was unconscious. Moreover, the present study also revealed that more transfer occurred between metaphorically related domains when judgment knowledge was conscious (intuition) rather than unconscious (guess). Conscious and unconscious judgment knowledge may have different functional properties.},

Here we performed multi-unit recordings from sensory neural populations in the electrosensory system of the weakly electric fish Apteronotus leptorhynchus in response to stimuli located at different positions along the rostro-caudal axis. Our results reveal that the spatial dependence of correlated activity along receptive fields can help mitigate the deleterious effects that these correlations would otherwise have if they were spatially independent. Moreover, using mathematical modeling, we show that experimentally observed heterogeneities in the receptive fields of neurons help optimize information transmission as to object location. Taken together, our results have important implications for understanding how sensory neurons whose receptive fields display antagonistic center-surround organization encode location. Important similarities between the electrosensory system and other sensory systems suggest that our results will be applicable elsewhere.},

The neuronal computations underlying these capacity limits have been extensively studied in humans and in monkeys, resulting in competing theoretical models. We probed the working memory capacity of crows (Corvus corone) in a change detection task, developed for monkeys (Macaca mulatta), while we performed extracellular recordings of the prefrontal-like area nidopallium caudolaterale. We found that neuronal encoding and maintenance of information were affected by item load, in a way that is virtually identical to results obtained from monkey prefrontal cortex. Contemporary neurophysiological models of working memory employ divisive normalization as an important mechanism that may result in the capacity limitation. As these models are usually conceptualized and tested in an exclusively mammalian context, it remains unclear if they fully capture a general concept of working memory or if they are restricted to the mammalian neocortex. Here, we report that carrion crows and macaque monkeys share divisive normalization as a neuronal computation that is in line with mammalian models. This indicates that computational models of working memory developed in the mammalian cortex can also apply to non-cortical associative brain regions of birds.},

  abstract = {The extent to which the major subdivisions of prefrontal cortex (PFC) can be functionally partitioned is unclear. In approaching the question, it is often assumed that the organization is task dependent. Here we use fMRI to show that PFC can respond in a task-independent way, and we leverage these responses to uncover a stimulus-driven functional organization. The results were generated by mapping the relative location of responses to faces, bodies, scenes, disparity, color, and eccentricity in four passively fixating macaques. The results control for individual differences in functional architecture and provide the first account of a systematic visual stimulus-driven functional organization across PFC. Responses were focused in dorsolateral PFC (DLPFC), in the ventral prearcuate region; and in ventrolateral PFC (VLPFC), extending into orbital PFC. Face patches were in the VLPFC focus and were characterized by a striking lack of response to non-face stimuli rather than an especially strong response to faces. Color-biased regions were near but distinct from face patches. One scene-biased region was consistently localized with different contrasts and overlapped the disparity-biased region to define the DLPFC focus. All visually responsive regions showed a peripheral visual-field bias. These results uncover an organizational scheme that presumably constrains the flow of information about different visual modalities into PFC.},

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$>$}Recent advances have made it possible to decode various aspects of visually presented stimuli from patterns of scalp EEG measurements. As of recently, such multivariate methods have been commonly used to decode visual-spatial features such as location, orientation, or spatial frequency. In the current proof-of-principle study, we show that it is also possible to track visual colour processing by using Linear Discriminant Analysis. Building on other recent demonstrations, we show that colour decoding: (1) reflects sensory qualities (as opposed to, for example, verbal labelling) with a prominent contribution from posterior electrodes contralateral to the stimulus, (2) conforms to a parametric coding space, (3) is possible in multi-item displays, and (4) is comparable in magnitude to the decoding of visual stimulus orientation. Through subsampling our data, we also provide an estimate of the approximate number of trials and participants required for robust decoding. Colour decoding opens a relevant new dimension in which to track visual processing using scalp EEG measurements, while bypassing potential confounds associated with decoding approaches that focus on spatial features.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

Here, we explored an alternative deep neural network, variational auto-encoder (VAE), as a computational model of the visual cortex. We trained a VAE with a five-layer encoder and a five-layer decoder to learn visual representations from a diverse set of unlabeled images. Using the trained VAE, we predicted and decoded cortical activity observed with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) from three human subjects passively watching natural videos. Compared to CNN, VAE could predict the video-evoked cortical responses with comparable accuracy in early visual areas, but relatively lower accuracy in higher-order visual areas. The distinction between CNN and VAE in terms of encoding performance was primarily attributed to their different learning objectives, rather than their different model architecture or number of parameters. Despite lower encoding accuracies, VAE offered a more convenient strategy for decoding the fMRI activity to reconstruct the video input, by first converting the fMRI activity to the VAE's latent variables, and then converting the latent variables to the reconstructed video frames through the VAE's decoder. This strategy was more advantageous than alternative decoding methods, e.g. partial least squares regression, for being able to reconstruct both the spatial structure and color of the visual input. Such findings highlight VAE as an unsupervised model for learning visual representation, as well as its potential and limitations for explaining cortical responses and reconstructing naturalistic and diverse visual experiences.},

  abstract = {The mammalian eye shows marked adaptations to time of day. Some of these modifications are not acute responses to short-term light exposure but rely upon assessments of the photic environment made over several hours. In the past, all attempts at a mechanistic understanding have assumed that these adaptations originate with light detection by one or other of the classical photoreceptor cells (rods or cones). However, previous work has demonstrated that the mammalian eye contains non-rod, non-cone photoreceptors. This study aimed to determine whether such photoreceptors contribute to retinal adaptation., In the human retina, second-order processing of signals originating in cones takes significantly longer at night than during the day. Long-term light exposure at night is capable of reversing this effect. Here, we employed the cone ERG as a tool to examine the properties of the irradiance measurement pathway driving this reversal. Our findings indicate that this pathway (1) integrates irradiance measures over time periods ranging from at least 15 to 120 min; (2) responds to relatively bright light, having a dynamic range almost entirely outside the sensitivity of rods; (3) acts on the cone pathway primarily through a local retinal mechanism; and (4) detects light via an opsin:vitamin A photopigment ({$\lambda$}max {$\cong$} 483 nm)., A photopigment with a spectral sensitivity profile quite different from those of the classical rod and cone opsins but matching the standard profile of an opsin:vitamin A-based pigment drives adaptations of the human primary cone visual pathway according to time of day.},

The noisy texture consisted of small squares of varying colors that were chosen randomly across the isoluminant plane. Classification images reveal that (1) the cardinal axes play no specific role; (2) the widths of the tuning curves vary between 30 and 90 deg, consistent with the variation of tuning widths of neurons at early cortical stages; and (3) detection is not based on the whole region covered by the signal but is influenced mostly by a small spot around the fixation point.},

Understanding that neural code is crucial to explaining how visual content is transformed via subsequent semantic representations to enable intelligent behavior. Although the visual code is not static, this reality is often obscured in voxel-wise encoding models of BOLD signals due to fMRI9s poor temporal resolution. We leveraged the high temporal resolution of EEG to develop an encoding technique based in state-space theory. This approach maps neural signals to each pixel within a given image and reveals location-specific transformations of the visual code, providing a spatiotemporal signature for the image at each electrode. This technique offers a spatiotemporal visualization of the evolution of the neural code of visual information thought impossible to obtain from EEG and promises to provide insight into how visual meaning is developed through dynamic feedforward and recurrent processes.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

In the delayed color estimation task (Wilken \& Ma, 2004), participants are given a set of colored squares to remember, and a few seconds later asked to reproduce those colors by clicking on a color wheel. The degree of error in these responses is characterized with mathematical models that estimate working memory precision and the proportion of items remembered by participants. A standard mathematical model of color memory assumes that items maintained in memory are remembered through memory for precise details about the particular studied shade of color. We contend that this model is incomplete in its present form because no mechanism is provided for remembering the coarse category of a studied color. In the present work, we remedy this omission and present a model of visual working memory that includes both continuous and categorical memory representations. In 2 experiments, we show that our new model outperforms this standard modeling approach, which demonstrates that categorical representations should be accounted for by mathematical models of visual working memory.

In this paper, the number of implemented eigenvectors has been virtually extended from three to six by estimation of another set of tristimulus values under illuminant A and 1964 standard observer. The second set of colorimetric data was predicted by the conventional non-linear regression method and used in the spectral reconstruction to produce a fully determined system in the case of six eigenvectors. The improvement obtained from the proposed modification was examined for the recovery of the reflectance spectra of Munsell color chips as well as ColorChecker DC samples. The performance is evaluated by the mean, maximum and standard deviation of color difference values under other sets of light sources. The values of mean, maximum and standard deviation of root mean square (RMS) errors between the reproduced and the actual spectra were also calculated. Results are compared with those obtained from traditional methods using the principal component analysis (PCA) routine. All metrics show that the suggested method leads to considerable improvements in comparison with the standard PCA approach.},

  abstract = {The human visual system seems to be particularly efficient at detecting faces. This efficiency sometimes comes at the cost of wrongfully seeing faces in arbitrary patterns, including famous examples such as a rock configuration on Mars or a toast's roast patterns. In machine vision, face detection has made considerable progress and has become a standard feature of many digital cameras. The arguably most wide-spread algorithm for such applications (``Viola-Jones'' algorithm) achieves high detection rates at high computational efficiency. To what extent do the patterns that the algorithm mistakenly classifies as faces also fool humans? We selected three kinds of stimuli from real-life, first-person perspective movies based on the algorithm's output: correct detections (``real faces''), false positives (``illusory faces'') and correctly rejected locations (``non faces''). Observers were shown pairs of these for 20 ms and had to direct their gaze to the location of the face. We found that illusory faces were mistaken for faces more frequently than non faces. In addition, rotation of the real face yielded more errors, while rotation of the illusory face yielded fewer errors. Using colored stimuli increases overall performance, but does not change the pattern of results. When replacing the eye movement by a manual response, however, the preference for illusory faces over non faces disappeared. Taken together, our data show that humans make similar face-detection errors as the Viola-Jones algorithm, when directing their gaze to briefly presented stimuli. In particular, the relative spatial arrangement of oriented filters seems of relevance. This suggests that efficient face detection in humans is likely to be pre-attentive and based on rather simple features as those encoded in the early visual system.},

Participants matched the colors of stimuli illuminated by low-pressure sodium light, which renders scenes monochromatic. Matches for fruit were not predicted by stimulus identity. In contrast, matches for faces were predictable, but surprising: faces appeared green and looked sick. The paradoxical face-color percept could be explained by a Bayesian observer model constrained by efficient coding. The color-matching data suggest that the face-color prior is established by visual signals arising from the recently evolved L-M cone system, not the older S-cone channel. Taken together, the results show that when retinal mechanisms of color vision are impaired, the impact of memory on color perception is greatest for face color, supporting the idea that trichromatic color plays an important role in social communication.},

  abstract = {The visual clarity of a lighting environment is significantly affected by changing the general color rendering index (Ra) of its illumination. This effect has been studied by a number of researchers, but the cause of this effect has not been thoroughly studied. In order to clarify this, the mutual relations between visual clarity, lightness perception, and feeling of contrast are analyzed by using object colors under illuminations with various Ra values. the results obtained are as follows. (1) the visual clarity of a lighting environment is different from the lightness perception of the object colors in the environment. (2) the change in visual clarity of a lighting environment is highly correlated to a feeling of contrast between object colors under the illumination. (3) the effect of visual clarity is estimated effectively by assessing the feeling of contrast using a specially selected four-color combination. (4) the illuminance for equal visual clarity for any illumination is predicted by the equality of feeling of contrast under the same illumination specified by the gamut area made by the component colors of the four-color combination in a brightness and colorfulness space. (5) the effect of visual clarity under various illuminations cannot be predicted by using their Ra values.},

A four-primary photostimulator provided independent control of the rod and three cone photoreceptor excitations. The rod contributions to the three post-receptoral pathways were estimated by perceptually matching a 20\% contrast rod pulse by independently varying the LMS (MC pathway), +L\&\#x2013;M (PC pathway), and S-cone (KC pathway) excitations. We show that extrinsic cone noise caused a predominant decrease in the overall magnitude and ratio of the rod contributions to each pathway. Thus, the relative cone activity in the post-receptoral pathways determines the relative mesopic rod inputs to each pathway.},

  abstract = {A rare type of ganglion cell in mammalian retina is directly photosensitive. These novel retinal photoreceptors express the photopigment melanopsin. They send axons directly to the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), intergeniculate leaflet (IGL), and olivary pretectal nucleus (OPN), thereby contributing to photic synchronization of circadian rhythms and the pupillary light reflex. Here, we sought to characterize more fully the projections of these cells to the brain. By targeting tau-lacZ to the melanopsin gene locus in mice, ganglion cells that would normally express melanopsin were induced to express, instead, the marker enzyme {$\beta$}-galactosidase. Their axons were visualized by X-gal histochemistry or anti-{$\beta$}-galactosidase immunofluorescence. Established targets were confirmed, including the SCN, IGL, OPN, ventral division of the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGv), and preoptic area, but the overall projections were more widespread than previously recognized. Targets included the lateral nucleus, peri-supraoptic nucleus, and subparaventricular zone of the hypothalamus, medial amygdala, margin of the lateral habenula, posterior limitans nucleus, superior colliculus, and periaqueductal gray. There were also weak projections to the margins of the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus. Co-staining with the cholera toxin B subunit to label all retinal afferents showed that melanopsin ganglion cells provide most of the retinal input to the SCN, IGL, and lateral habenula and much of that to the OPN, but that other ganglion cells do contribute at least some retinal input to these targets. Staining patterns after monocular enucleation revealed that the projections of these cells are overwhelmingly crossed except for the projection to the SCN, which is bilaterally symmetrical. J. Comp.

  abstract = {In the mammalian retina, besides the conventional rod\textendash cone system, a melanopsin-associated photoreceptive system exists that conveys photic information for accessory visual functions such as pupillary light reflex and circadian photo-entrainment. On ablation of the melanopsin gene, retinal ganglion cells that normally express melanopsin are no longer intrinsically photosensitive. Furthermore, pupil reflex, light-induced phase delays of the circadian clock and period lengthening of the circadian rhythm in constant light are all partially impaired. Here, we investigated whether additional photoreceptive systems participate in these responses. Using mice lacking rods and cones, we measured the action spectrum for phase-shifting the circadian rhythm of locomotor behaviour. This spectrum matches that for the pupillary light reflex in mice of the same genotype, and that for the intrinsic photosensitivity of the melanopsin-expressing retinal ganglion cells. We have also generated mice lacking melanopsin coupled with disabled rod and cone phototransduction mechanisms. These animals have an intact retina but fail to show any significant pupil reflex, to entrain to light/dark cycles, and to show any masking response to light. Thus, the rod\textendash cone and melanopsin systems together seem to provide all of the photic input for these accessory visual functions.},

Retinal rod and cone cells are not required for photoentrainment. Recent evidence suggests that the entraining photoreceptors are retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) that project to the SCN. The visual pigment for this photoreceptor may be melanopsin, an opsin-like protein whose coding messenger RNA is found in a subset of mammalian RGCs. By cloning rat melanopsin and generating specific antibodies, we show that melanopsin is present in cell bodies, dendrites, and proximal axonal segments of a subset of rat RGCs. In mice heterozygous for tau-lacZ targeted to the melanopsin gene locus, {$\beta$}-galactosidase\textendash positive RGC axons projected to the SCN and other brain nuclei involved in circadian photoentrainment or the pupillary light reflex.

  abstract = {The notion of internalization put forth by Roger Shepard continues to be appealing and challenging. He suggests that we have internalized, during our evolutionary development, environmental regularities, or constraints. Internalization solves one of the hardest problems of perceptual psychology: the underspecification problem. That is the problem of how well-defined perceptual experience is generated from the often ambiguous and incomplete sensory stimulation. Yet, the notion of internalization creates new problems that may outweigh the solution of the underspecification problem. To support this claim, I first examine the concept of internalization, breaking it down into several distinct interpretations. These range from well-resolved dynamic regularities to ill-resolved statistical regularities. As a function of the interpretation the researcher selects, an empirical test of the internalization hypothesis may be straightforward or it may become virtually impossible. I then attempt to cover the range of interpretations by drawing on examples from different domains of visual event perception. Unfortunately, the experimental tests regarding most candidate regularities, such as gravitational acceleration, fail to support the concept of internalization. This suggests that narrow interpretations of the concept should be given up in favor of more abstract interpretations. However, the latter are not easily amenable to empirical testing. There is nonetheless a way to test these abstract interpretations by contrasting internalization with the opposite concept: externalization of body dynamics. I summarize evidence for such a projection of body constraints onto external objects. Based on the combined evidence of well-resolved and ill- resolved regularities, the value of the notion of internalization has to be reassessed.},

  abstract = {Energy conservation in building arena is essential issue for achieving sustainable environment. However, buildings experienced significant amount of heat gain or loss through window and this will affect the thermal comfort of buildings׳ occupants. Building without window is able to save energy, but it is not recommended due to the benefits of natural light on visual comfort and the biological effect of natural light on humans. Hence, window design plays important role in building architect. One of the essential parts of window is the glazing. Selecting a window glazing is complicated when energy saving and daylighting aspects of a building are considered concurrently. Optimization techniques offer a balance solution for the contradictions in selecting a window glazing of energy-efficient building. This paper intended to reveal the impacts of window glazing on the energy and daylighting performances of building through the previous researches. Then, the optimization techniques used by various researchers in choosing a glazing are highlighted. The emerging glazing technologies were discussed as well.},

I used 20 English-speaking female undergraduates and 10 foreign students to complete previous location of these focal colors on the dimensions of hue, value, and saturation. In Exp. II, 23 speakers of different languages named a sample of focal and nonfocal colors. In Exp. III, 20 English speakers and 21 New Guinea Dani, speakers of a language which lacks hue names, remembered and recognized focal and nonfocal colors. In Exp. IV, 19 Dani learned names for focal and nonfocal colors in a paired-associates task. Results show that focal colors (a) were given the shortest names and named most rapidly across languages, (b) were the most accurately recognized both by English and Dani speakers, and (c) could be paired with names with fewest errors. On the basis of these findings, linguistically causal interpretations of earlier language-cognition studies using color are challenged. (20 ref.)

  abstract = {In a previous work, it was shown that there is a curious problem with the benchmark Color Checker dataset for illuminant estimation. To wit, this dataset has at least 3 different sets of ground-truths. Typically, for a single algorithm a single ground-truth is used. But then different algorithms, whose performance is measured with respect to different ground-truths, are compared against each other and then ranked. This makes no sense. In fact it is nonsense. We show in this paper that there are also errors in how each ground-truth set was calculated. As a result, all performance rankings based on the Color Checker dataset - and there are scores of these - are ill-founded. In this paper, we re-generate a new 'recommended' set of ground-truth based on the calculation methodology described by Shi and Funt. We then review the performance evaluation of a range of illuminant estimation algorithms. Compared with the legacy ground-truths, we find that the difference in how algorithms perform can be large with many local rankings of algorithms being reversed. Finally, we draw the readers attention to our new 'open' data repository which, we hope, will allow the Color Checker set to be rehabilitated and, once again, to become a useful benchmark for illuminant estimation algorithms.},

Similar in physiology and connectivity to W cells in cat lateral geniculate nucleus, K cells form three pairs of layers in macaques. The middle pair relays input from short-wavelength cones to the cytochrome-oxidase blobs of primay visual cortex (V1), the dorsal-most pair relays low-acuity visual information to layer I of V1, and the ventral-most pair appears closely tied to the function of the superior colliculus. Throughout each K layer are neurons that innervate extrastriate cortex and that are likely to sustain some visual behaviors in the absence of V1. These data show that several pathways exist from retina to V1 that are likely to process different aspects of the visual scene along lines that may remain parallel well into V1.},

Researchers \textendash{} often implicitly \textendash{} assume that either there is little variation across human populations, or that these ``standard subjects'' are as representative of the species as any other population. Are these assumptions justified? Here, our review of the comparative database from across the behavioral sciences suggests both that there is substantial variability in experimental results across populations and that WEIRD subjects are particularly unusual compared with the rest of the species \textendash{} frequent outliers. The domains reviewed include visual perception, fairness, cooperation, spatial reasoning, categorization and inferential induction, moral reasoning, reasoning styles, self-concepts and related motivations, and the heritability of IQ. The findings suggest that members of WEIRD societies, including young children, are among the least representative populations one could find for generalizing about humans. Many of these findings involve domains that are associated with fundamental aspects of psychology, motivation, and behavior \textendash{} hence, there are no obvious a priori grounds for claiming that a particular behavioral phenomenon is universal based on sampling from a single subpopulation. Overall, these empirical patterns suggests that we need to be less cavalier in addressing questions of human nature on the basis of data drawn from this particularly thin, and rather unusual, slice of humanity. We close by proposing ways to structurally re-organize the behavioral sciences to best tackle these challenges.},

Although numerous cases have been reported, few of those investigations have carried out formal testing motivated by theories of face perception. However, because PMO involves conscious visual distortions to faces which participants can report, it can be used to probe fundamental questions about face representations. Here we review cases of PMO that address theoretical questions in visual neuroscience including face specificity, inverted face processing, the importance of the vertical midline, dissociable representations for each half of the face, hemispheric specialization, the relationship between face recognition and conscious face perception, and the reference frames that face representations are embedded within. Finally, we list and touch upon eighteen open questions that make clear how much is left to learn about PMO and the potential it has to provide important advances in face perception.},

  abstract = {A model for brightness and hue perception of self-luminous stimuli surrounded by a self-luminous achromatic background has been developed based on a series of visual experiments. In the model, only the absolute spectral radiance values of the stimulus and background are used as input. Normalized cone excitations are calculated using the 10\textdegree{} Commission Internationale de l'\'Eclairage (CIE) 2006 cone fundamentals. A von Kries chromatic adaptation transform applied in the CIE 2006 cone space is adopted, and luminance compression and adaptation due to the self-luminous background are included by using a Michaelis\textendash Menten function. Model parameters are determined by fitting the model to the experimental visual data obtained for brightness, hue, and the amount of color versus neutral. The model is validated with additional experimental data. An absolute brightness scale expressed in ``bright'' is proposed.},

We use spectral radiances measured within 3\textdegree{} fields of view (FOV's) to define colorimetric characteristics along four sky meridians: the solar meridian and three meridians at azimuths of 45\textdegree, 90\textdegree, and 315\textdegree{} relative to it. The resulting clear-sky chromaticities in 44 different view directions (1) are close to but do not coincide with the CIE daylight locus, (2) form V-shaped meridional chromaticity curves along it (as expected from theory), and (3) have correlated color temperatures (CCT's) ranging from 3800 K to {$\infty$} K. We also routinely observe that sky color and luminance are asymmetric about the solar meridian, usually perceptibly so. A principal-components analysis shows that three vectors are required for accurate clear-sky colorimetry, whereas six are needed for spectral analyses.},

We have resorted to such linear models to recover spectral daylight with the response of no more than a few real sensors. We performed an exhaustive search to obtain the best set of Gaussian sensors with a combination of optimum spectral position and bandwidth. We also examined to what extent the accuracy of daylight estimation depends on the number of sensors and their spectral properties. A set of 2600 daylight spectra [J. Opt. Soc. Am. A18, 1325 (2001)] were used to determine the basis functions in the linear model and also to evaluate the accuracy of the search. The estimated spectra are compared with the original ones for different spectral daylight and skylight sets of data within the visible spectrum. Spectral similarity, colorimetric differences, and integrated spectral irradiance errors were all taken into account. We compare our best results with those obtained by using a commercial CCD, revealing the CCD's potential as a daylight-estimation device.},

Hue discrimination improves if a small luminance contrast is added. This effect is strongest for small test objects, and decreases as the size of the test object increases, or as the spatial frequency of the grating decreases, so that luminance contrast has little effect on hue discrimination measured with a 2\textdegree{} bipartite field. When measured with equiluminous square-wave gratings, an observer's sensitivity to small wavelength differences increases monotonically as spatial frequency is decreased. When a luminance contrast is included, maximum sensitivity occurs when the grating has a spatial frequency of about 3 cycles/deg, and decreases at higher and lower spatial frequencies, so that its shape resembles the luminance modulation transfer function of the visual system. Hue-discrimination performance is better when measurements are made with the 3-cycles/deg grating with luminance contrast than with a conventional bipartite field.},

Traditional methods that rely on verbal descriptions from participants pose challenges in neuroimaging studies. To address this, our group has introduced a novel ``qualia structure'' paradigm that leverages exhaustive, structural, and relational comparisons among qualia instead of verbal reports. In this study, we present the first fMRI dataset that captures relational similarity judgments among two out of nine color qualia per trial from 35 participants. This dataset also includes a ``no-report'' condition in half of the trials to assess the impact of overt reporting. Additionally, each participant's color discriminability was evaluated with a hue test conducted outside the scanner. Our data offer valuable insights into the brain functions associated with color qualia and contribute to a deeper understanding of the neural foundations of consciousness.},

Qualitatively, colour dimorphism appears more pronounced in marine fishes that live on coral reefs where traits associated with strong sexual selection are purportedly more common. Using phylogenetic comparative analysis, we show that wrasses and parrotfishes exclusive to coral reefs are the most colour dimorphic, but surprisingly, the effect of habitat is not influenced by traits associated with strong sexual selection. Rather, habitat-specific selective forces, including clear water and structural refuge, promote the evolution of pronounced colour dimorphism that manifests colours less likely to be displayed in other habitats. Our results demonstrate that environmental context ultimately determines the evolution of conspicuous coloration in colour-dimorphic labrid fishes, despite other influential selective forces.},

To determine the brightness perception of colored objects, luminance calculations and measurements were conducted. The areas of the ``color brightness graph'' in this study correspond to the results of eight different color sample papers under each of the LED lights with different CCTs. The luminance values were calculated by multiplying the SPD by the spectral luminous efficiency and spectral reflectance of a colored object. The luminance values were measured under these conditions to identify the relationship between the luminance calculations and the measured values. Efficient CCTs were identified for each color sample in terms of the brightness of the colored object. Further subjective evaluations were also conducted to identify the relationship between luminance values and subjective brightness perception. In addition, subjective evaluations of the color appearance perception were conducted to identify the overall visibility concept of colored objects. The subjective evaluations included brightness perception, color appearance, and similarity of the reference light source. The visibility of the colored objects was analyzed according to the results of the brightness and appearance perception of the colored objects that were illuminated by LED lights with various CCTs. \textcopyright{} 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

To investigate this, we used a color WM task in which subjects viewed colored stimuli and reported both an estimate of a stimulus color and a measure of memory uncertainty, obtained through a rewarded decision. Reported memory uncertainty is correlated with memory error, showing that people incorporate their trial-to-trial memory quality into rewarded decisions. Moreover, memory uncertainty can be combined with other sources of information; after inducing expectations (prior beliefs) about stimuli probabilities, we found that estimates became shifted toward expected colors, with the shift increasing with reported uncertainty. The data are best fit by models in which people incorporate their trial-to-trial memory uncertainty with potential rewards and prior beliefs. Our results suggest that WM represents uncertainty information, and that this can be combined with prior beliefs. This highlights the potential complexity of WM representations and shows that rewarded decision can be a powerful tool for examining WM and informing and constraining theoretical, computational, and neurobiological models of memory.},

  abstract = {The ranges of stimuli that are perceived as white were investigated in a dark surround. Stimulus light was supplied by three gas-filled tungsten lamps modified with three glass filters and an opal glass. Chromaticity and luminance were changed by adjusting distances between the opal glass and each of the lamps. We employed the method of minimal changes and the constant-stimulus method. In the former case, the luminances of two of the stimulus components were kept fixed, while the observer was allowed to change the luminance of the other component. Ranges of chromaticities reported as white with a probability of 0.5 or more by three observers were located along straight lines near the blackbody locus, at color temperatures higher than 5500 K. With the constant-stimulus method, 45 observers judged 18 stimuli located at different positions in the neighborhood of CIE standard source C in the chromaticity diagram, all of which had luminances equal to 20 asb. The result was that an oval range of points reported as white with a 0.5 probability was obtained around CIE standard source C.},

Our work is motivated by the observation that previous analysis of algorithm performance is flawed because it uses inappropriate statistical measures of performance. We discuss these flaws in detail and suggest more appropriate statistical tests. We show that using these tests conclusions as to the relative performance of algorithms are significantly changed as compared to the original analysis of the data. In particular we conclude that the performance of two algorithms: Gamut mapping and color by correlation is statistically equivalent and significantly better than the three other algorithms tested (Max-RGB and two versions of Grey-world).},

  abstract = {The presence of a photopigment (melanopsin) within certain retinal ganglion cells was a surprising and significant discovery. This pigment is routinely described as ``nonvisual'' to highlight its signaling role in pupil dilation and circadian rhythms. Here we asked whether light absorbed by melanopsin can be seen by healthy human subjects. To answer this requires delivering intense (above rod saturation), well-controlled lights using four independent primaries. We collected detection thresholds to many four-primary stimuli. Threshold measurements in the fovea are explained by trichromatic theory, with no need to invoke a fourth photopigment. In the periphery, where melanopsin is present, threshold measurements deviate from trichromatic theory; at high photopic levels, sensitivity is explained by absorptions in four, not three, photopigment classes. We consider a series of hypotheses to explain the tetrasensitivity at high photopic levels in the human peripheral field. The most likely hypothesis is that in healthy human subjects melanopsin absorptions influence visibility.},

In this study, we measured the impact of color discrimination repetitions at a specific base color on color perception for entire hues. Participants performed five sessions of color discrimination training (200 or 300 trials per session) over five days, at colors on either the negative or positive direction of the L-M color axis, based on group assignment. We administered three color perception assessments (unique hues, color category boundaries, and color appearance) before and after the sessions to evaluate perceptual changes after training. The results showed declines in color discrimination thresholds after training, as expected. Additionally, the training influenced outcomes across all three assessment types. After the training, the perceived color appearance changed near the trained color along the stimulus hue, and some of the unique hues and the color category boundaries moved significantly toward the trained color. These findings indicate that short-term repetitions of color discrimination training can alter color representations in the visual system, distorting color perception around the trained color.},

  abstract = {The vertebrate retina is a distinctly laminar structure. Functionally, the inner plexiform layer, in which bipolar cells synapse onto amacrine and ganglion cells, is subdivided into two sublaminae. Cells that depolarize at light offset ramify in sublamina a; those that depolarize at light onset ramify in sublamina b. The separation of ON and OFF pathways appears to be a fundamental principle of retinal organization that is reflected throughout the entire visual system. We show three clear exceptions to this rule, in which the axons of calbindin-positive ON cone bipolar cells make ribbon synapses as they pass through the OFF layers with three separate cell types: (1) dopaminergic amacrine cells, (2) intrinsically photosensitive ganglion cells, and (3) bistratified diving ganglion cells. The postsynaptic location of the AMPA receptor GluR4 at these sites suggests that ON bipolar cells can make functional synapses as their axons pass through the OFF layers of the inner plexiform layer. These findings resolve a long-standing question regarding the anomalous ON inputs to dopaminergic amacrine cells and suggest that certain ON bipolar cell axons can break the stratification rules of the inner plexiform layer by providing significant synaptic output before their terminal specializations. These outputs are not only to dopaminergic amacrine cells but also to at least two ON ganglion cell types that have dendrites that arborize in sublamina a.},

The two evaluation modes produced comparable results. Though the side-by-side method has in the past been questioned by others, the data herein illustrates that it is neither faulty nor invalid. Red, green, and blue LEDs were employed to create four light settings that were permutations of two S/P ratios (1.7 and 2.6) and two luminance levels (24 and 30 cd/m2). The S/P ratios corresponded to the practical extremities of CCT (2900 and 7200 K) and were structured to have their chromaticity on the blackbody locus. At equal luminance there was no difference in the perception of brightness, irrespective of CCT. At unequal luminance, but when the ratio of P*(S/P)0.5 was set to 1:1, brightness perception was predicted by luminance. These data suggest that spatial brightness perceptions at photopic light levels are unrelated to the S/P ratio of the illumination. These results are consistent with the ``prime color'' theory of vision that is rooted in the trichromatic nature of human vision.},

  abstract = {Colour preference for lighting is generally influenced by three kinds of contextual factors, the light, the object and the observer. In this study, a series of psychophysical experiments were conducted to investigate and compare the effect of certain factors on colour preference, including spectral power distribution of light, lighting application, observers' personal colour preference, regional cultural difference and gender difference. LED lights with different correlated colour temperatures were used to illuminate a wide selection of objects. Participant response was quantified by a 7-point rating method or a 5-level ranking method. It was found that the preferred illumination for different objects exhibited a similar trend and that the influence of light was significantly stronger than that of other factors. Therefore, we conclude that the light itself (rather than, e.g. the objects that are viewed) is the most crucial factor for predicting which light, among several candidates with different correlated colour temperatures, an observer will prefer. In addition, some of the gamut-based colour quality metrics correlated well with the participants' response, which corroborates the view that colour preference is strongly influenced by colour saturation. The familiarity of the object affects the ratings for each experiment while the colour of the objects also influences colour preference.},

  abstract = {Light plays a pivotal role in the regulation of affective behaviors. However, the precise circuits that mediate the impact of light on depressive-like behaviors are not well understood. Here, we show that light influences depressive-like behaviors through a disynaptic circuit linking the retina and the lateral habenula (LHb). Specifically, M4-type melanopsin-expressing retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) innervate GABA neurons in the thalamic ventral lateral geniculate nucleus and intergeniculate leaflet (vLGN/IGL), which in turn inhibit CaMKII{$\alpha$} neurons in the LHb. Specific activation of vLGN/IGL-projecting RGCs, activation of LHb-projecting vLGN/IGL neurons, or inhibition of postsynaptic LHb neurons is sufficient to decrease the~depressive-like behaviors evoked by long-term exposure to aversive stimuli or chronic social defeat stress. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the antidepressive effects of light therapy require activation of the retina-vLGN/IGL-LHb pathway. These results reveal a dedicated retina-vLGN/IGL-LHb circuit that regulates depressive-like behaviors and provide a potential mechanistic explanation for light treatment of depression.},

  abstract = {In this work, the correlation between the perceived whiteness of lighting and the corresponding colour preference of observers was comprehensively investigated based on the data of 19 groups of experiments collected from 14 studies. The dataset included 13 experiments with constant correlated colour temperature and 6 experiments with multiple correlated colour temperatures, with illuminance levels ranging from 200\,lx to 500\,lx. For the five studies implemented by the authors, the subjective ratings of colour preference and the whiteness of lighting were acquired. For other cases, only the preference ratings were collected while the whiteness of lighting was quantified by a measure named degree of neutrality (Sneutral), which has been validated in our previous work. The meta-analysis results confirm our former statement that people prefer whiter illumination and further specify its prerequisite. That is, the whiteness of lighting generally correlates well with colour preference under the conditions where the candidate lights differed to a certain extent in white. In addition, it was further demonstrated that for the scenarios with multiple correlated colour temperatures ranging from 2500\,K to 5500\,K people indeed preferred perceptually whiter light chromaticities, while for correlated colour temperatures higher than 5500\,K it seemed that they appeared too cold to be preferred.},

  abstract = {Visual sensitivity is a process that allows the visual system to maintain optimal response over a wide range of ambient light levels and chromaticities. Several studies have used variants of the probe\textendash flash paradigm to show that the time course of adaptation to abrupt changes in ambient luminance depends on both receptoral and postreceptoral mechanisms. Though a few studies have explored how these processes govern adaptation to color changes, most of this effort has targeted the L\textendash M-cone pathway. The purpose of our work was to use the probe\textendash flash paradigm to more fully explore light adaptation in both the L\textendash M- and the S-cone pathways. We measured sensitivity to chromatic probes presented after the onset of a 2-s chromatic flash. Test and flash stimuli were spatially coextensive 2\textdegree{} fields presented in Maxwellian view. Flash stimuli were presented as excursions from white and could extended in one of two directions along an equiluminant L\textendash M-cone or S-cone line. Probes were presented as excursions from the adapting flash chromaticity and could extend either toward the spectrum locus or toward white. For both color lines, the data show a fast and slow adaptation component, although this was less evident in the S-cone data. The fast and slow components were modeled as first- and second-site adaptive processes, respectively. We find that the time course of adaptation is different for the two cardinal pathways. In addition, the time course for S-cone stimulation is polarity dependent. Our results characterize the rapid time course of adaptation in the chromatic pathways and reveal that the mechanics of adaptation within the S-cone pathway are distinct from those in the L\textendash M-cone pathways.},

For related colours, for a given chromaticity, the changes in hue caused by changing the luminance factor are examined in the Munsell and NCS systems; although systematic variations occur, they are different in the two systems, and in neither case is there any similarity to the situation for unrelated colours. Changes in illuminance on related colours do not seem to have any systematic effect on hue for a given chromaticity.

  abstract = {Although trichromacy in Old and New World primates is based on three visual pigments with spectral peaks in the violet (SW, shortwave), green (MW, middlewave) and yellow\textendash green (LW, longwave) regions of the spectrum, the underlying genetic mechanisms differ. The SW pigment is encoded in both cases by an autosomal gene and, in Old World primates, the MW and LW pigments by separate genes on the X chromosome. In contrast, there is a single polymorphic X-linked gene in most New World primates with three alleles coding for spectrally distinct pigments. The one reported exception to this rule is the New World howler monkey that follows the Old World system of separate LW and MW genes. A comparison of gene sequences in these different genetic systems indicates that the duplication that gave rise to the separate MW and LW genes of Old World primates is more ancient than that in the howler monkey. In addition, the amino acid sequences of the two howler monkey pigments show similarities to the pigments encoded by the polymorphic gene of other New World primates. It would appear therefore that the howler monkey gene duplication arose after the split between New and Old World primates and was generated by an unequal crossover that placed two different forms of the New World polymorphic gene on to a single chromosome. In contrast, the lack of identity at variable sites within the New and Old World systems argues for the origin of the separate genes in Old World primates by the duplication of a single form of the gene followed by divergence to give spectrally distinct LW and MW pigments. In contrast, the similarity in amino acid variation across the tri-allelic system of New World primates indicates that this polymorphism had a single origin in New World primates. A striking feature of all these pigments is the use of a common set of substitutions at three amino acid sites to achieve the spectral shift from MW at around 530 nm to LW at around 560 nm. The separate origin of the trichromacy in New and Old World primates would indicate that the selection of these three sites is the result of convergent evolution, perhaps as a consequence of visual adaptation in both cases to foraging for yellow and orange fruits against a green foliage.},

Lighting plays a significant role in developing interaction between humans and museum artifacts in one defined space. " Museums are places where lighting design is critical to the overall experience''( Lowe,43, 2009). Lighting is essential for human interaction in a space. Technical illumination research lays a foundation to conduct analysis in a variety of museums. This research component is significant to understand the complexity and various facets of overall museum lighting design. This study evaluates both the quantitative and qualitative aspects of lighting design in four museums.

  abstract = {Summary The long history of color preference studies has been described as ``bewildering, confused and contradictory'' [1]. Although recent studies [1\textendash 3] tend to agree on a universal preference for `blue', the variety and lack of control in measurement methods have made it difficult to extract a systematic, quantitative description of preference. Furthermore, despite abundant evidence for sex differences in other visual domains, and specifically in other tasks of color perception [4,5], there is no conclusive evidence for the existence of sex differences in color preference. This fact is perhaps surprising, given the prevalence and longevity of the notion that little girls differ from boys in preferring `pink' [6]. Here we report a robust, cross-cultural sex difference in color preference, revealed by a rapid paired-comparison task. Individual color preference patterns are summarized by weights on the two fundamental neural dimensions that underlie color coding in the human visual system. We find a consistent sex difference in these weights, which, we suggest, may be linked to the evolution of sex-specific behavioral uses of trichromacy.},

Yet color constancy is highly variable, depending on the illumination, the object and its context, and the viewer. Color constancy is particularly challenged by artificial lights that differ from the natural illuminations under which human vision evolved. The rapid developments in solid-state lighting technologies revive the need to scrutinise the limits of color constancy, to understand whether and how it is optimised for natural illuminations, and, in turn, to optimise novel lighting technologies for human color perception. For these goals, a deeper collaboration between the disciplines of human vision science and color science is needed.},

  abstract = {Color constancy \textemdash{} by which objects tend to appear the same color under changes in illumination \textemdash{} is most likely achieved by several mechanisms, operating at different levels in the visual system. One powerful contributory mechanism is simultaneous spatial color contrast. Under changes in natural illumination the spatial ratios of within-type cone excitations between natural surfaces tend to be preserved (Foster and Nascimento, 1994); therefore, the neural encoding of colors as spatial contrasts tends to achieve constancy. Several factors are known to influence the strength of chromatic contrast induction between surfaces, including their relative luminance, spatial scale, spatial configuration and context (Ware and Cowan, 1982; Zaidi et al., 1991). Here we test the hypothesis that color contrast is weakened by differences between surfaces which indicate that they may be under distinct illuminants. We summarize psychophysical measurements of the effects of relative motion, relative depth and texture differences on chromatic contrast induction. Of these factors, only texture differences between surfaces weaken chromatic contrast induction. We also consider neurophysiological and neuropsychological evidence and conclude that the mechanisms which mediate local chromatic contrast effects are sited at low levels in the visual system, in primary visual cortex (V1) or below, prior to image segmentation mechanisms which require computation of relative depth or motion. V1 and lower areas may therefore play a larger role in color constancy than previously thought.},

The synthesizing technique, optimal linear estimation, requires only one assumption, that the operator that transforms input into output is linear.

Existing statistic based colour constancy methods use whole image pixel values for illuminant estimation. However, not every region of an image contains reliable colour information. Therefore, the presence of large uniform colour patches within the image considerably deteriorates the performance of colour constancy algorithms. This paper presents an algorithm to alleviate the biasing effect of the uniform colour patches of the colour constancy compensation techniques. It employs the k-means clustering algorithm to segment image areas according to their colour information. The Average Absolute Difference (AAD) of each colour component of the segment is calculated and used to identify and exclude segments with uniform colour information from being used for colour constancy adjustments. Experimental results were generated using three benchmark datasets and compared with the state of the art techniques. Results show the proposed technique outperforms existing techniques in the presence of the uniform colour patches and similar to Grey World method in the absent o uniform colour patches.},

The results of the succeeding awakening formed the theme of my retiring address as Chairman of The Colour Group (Great Britain) on 13th May, 1981, at the Royal Institution, London. Life, it seems, was destined to become coloured from the start and it has become a more and more colourful place as evolution has continued. Colour and design are vital, in different ways, to the life and perpetuation of different biological systems. I have attempted to amalgamate the views of the biologist, biochemist, anthropologist, and physicist (among others), to give a personal overall view of the driving forces and principles of appearance and colouration in the world of nature. The three articles to follow consider, first, the mechanisms which result in the colour of primary producers using the photosynthetic process; second, the mechanisms which produce colouration and total appearance in flowering plants and animals; and third, human colouration and man's use of colour, stopping short of modern technology. I hope that these findings will add to the everyday joy which you can experience in your natural environment.},

  abstract = {Inherited color vision deficiencies typically result from a loss or alteration of the visual photopigments absorbing light and thus impact the very first step of seeing. There is growing interest in how subsequent steps in the visual pathway might be calibrated to compensate for the altered receptor signals, with the possibility that color coding and color percepts might be less severely impacted than the receptor differences predict. These compensatory adjustments provide important insights into general questions about sensory plasticity and the sensory and cognitive processes underlying how we experience color.},

The color degradation of natural dyes and blue scale standards (JIS L 0841) by white LED lamps are examined, and the performance of white LED lamps for museum lighting is evaluated. Blue scale standard grades 1-6 and silk fabrics dyed with 22 types of natural dyes classified as mid to highly responsive in a CIE technical report (CIE157:2004) were exposed to five types of white LED lamps using different luminescence methods and color temperatures. Color changes were measured at each 15000 lx{$\cdot$}hr (500 lx at fabric surface \texttimes{} 300 hr) interval ten times. The accumulated exposure totaled 150000 lx{$\cdot$}hr. The data on conventional white LED lamps and previously reported white fluorescent (W) and museum fluorescent (NU) lamps was evaluated. All the white LED lamps showed lower fading rates compared with a W lamp on a blue scale grade 1. The fading rate of natural dyes in total was the same between an NU lamp (3000 K) and a white LED lamp (2869 K). However, yellow natural dyes showed higher fading rates with the white LED lamp. This tendency is due to the high power characteristic of the LED lamp around 400-500 nm, which possibly contributes to the photo-fading action on the dyes. The most faded yellow dyes were Ukon (Curcuma longa L.) and Kihada (Phellodendron amurense Rupr.), and these are frequently used in historic artifacts such as kimono, wood-block prints, and scrolls. From a conservation point of view, we need to continue research on white LED lamps for use in museum lighting.},

By use of the simple vector-subspace model that we propose, spectral information can be stored and recovered by the use of a few inner products, which are easy to measure optically. Two large data sets, the first consisting of 1257 Munsell colors and the other of 218 naturally occurring spectral reflectances, were analyzed to form two bases for the model. The Munsell basis can be used to represent the natural colors, and the basis derived from the natural data can be used to represent the Munsell data. The proposed vector-subspace model includes a simple relation between the inner products and conventional color coordinates. It also provides a way to estimate the spectrum of an object that has known chromaticity coordinates.},

  abstract = {A fundamental observation in the neurosciences is that the brain is a modular system in which different regions perform different tasks. Recent evidence, however, raises questions about the accuracy of this characterization with respect to neo-nates. One possible interpretation of this evidence is that certain aspects of the modular organization of the adult brain arise developmentally. To explore this hypothesis we wish to characterize the computational principles that underlie the development of modular systems. In previous work we have considered computational schemes that allow a learning system to discover the modular structure that is present in the environment (Jacobs, Jordan, \&amp; Barto, 1991). In the current paper we present a complementary approach in which the development of modularity is due to an architectural bias in the learner. In particular, we examine the computational consequences of a simple architectural bias toward short-range connections. We present simulations that show that systems that learn under the influence of such a bias have a number of desirable properties, including a tendency to decompose tasks into subtasks, to decouple the dynamics of recurrent subsystems, and to develop location-sensitive internal representations. Furthermore, the system's units develop local receptive and projective fields, and the system develops characteristics that are typically associated with topographic maps.},

Today reverberations from the Berlin \& Kay (1969) research program continue to resonate through recently available data sets that are being examined with new quantitative analysis methods and modeling approaches.

Recent empirical evidence finds color processing differs both within and across cultures. This divergent color processing raises new questions about the sources of previously observed cultural coherence and cross-cultural universality. The present article evaluates the relevance of individual variation on the mainstream model of color naming. It also presents an alternate view that specifies how color naming and categorization is shaped by both panhuman cognitive universals and socio-cultural evolutionary processes. This alternative view, expressed, in part, using an \emph{Interpoint Distance Model} of color categorization, is compatible with new empirical results showing divergent color processing within and across cultures. It suggests that universalities in color naming and categorization may naturally arise across cultures because color language and color categories primarily reflect culturally modal linguistic mappings, and categories are shaped by universal cognitive constructs and culturally salient features of color. Thus, a shared cultural representation of color based on widely shared cognitive dimensions may be the proper foundation for universalities of color naming and categorization. Across cultures this form of representation may result from convergent responses to similar pressures on color lexicon evolution.},

  abstract = {The evolution of color categorization is investigated using computer simulations of agent population categorization games. Various realistic observer types are implemented based on Farnsworth-Munsell 100 Hue Test human performance data from normal and anomalous trichromats, dichromats, and humans with four retinal photopigments. Results show that (i) a small percentage of realistically modeled deficient agents greatly affects the shared categorization solutions of the entire population in terms of color category boundary locations; (ii) for realistically modeled populations, dichromats have the strongest influence on the color categorization; their characteristic forms of color confusion affect (i.e., attract or repel) color boundary locations and accord with our findings for homogeneous dichromat populations [J. Opt. Soc. Am. A26, 1414-1423 (2009)]; (iii) adding anomalous trichromats or trichromat ``experts'' does not destabilize the solutions or substantially alter solution structure. The results provide insights regarding the mechanisms that may constrain universal tendencies in human color categorization systems.},

  abstract = {The time course of recovery from chromatic adaptation in human vision was tracked by determining the wavelength of light that appears uniquely yellow (neither red nor green) both before and after exposure to yellowish green and yellowish red adapting lights. Recovery is complete within 5 min after steady light exposure. After exposure to the alternating repeated sequence 10-sec light/10-sec dark, the initial magnitude of the aftereffect is reduced but recovery is retarded. The results are interpreted in terms of two processes located at different levels in the hierarchical organization of the visual system. One is a change in the balance of cone receptor sensitivities; the second is a shift in the equilibrium baseline between opposite-signed responses of the red/green channel at the opponent-process neural level. The baseline-shift mechanism is effective in the condition in which repeated input signals originating at the receptors are of sufficient strength to activate the system effectively. Hence, this process is revealed in the alternating adaptation condition when the receptors undergo partial recovery after each light exposure, but receptor adaptation during continued steady light exposure effectively protects the subsequent neural systems from continued strong activation.},

  abstract = {Freshwater ecosystems are hotspots of biodiversity. They are of major importance for humans because they provide vital ecosystem services. However, as humans tend to settle near freshwaters and coastal areas, these ecosystems are also over-proportionally affected by anthropogenic stressors. Artificial light at night can occur as a form of environmental pollution, light pollution. Light pollution affects large areas on a worldwide scale, is growing exponentially in radiance and extent and can have diverse negative effects on flora, fauna and on human health. While the majority of ecological studies on artificial light at night covered terrestrial systems, the studies on aquatic light pollution have unraveled impact on aquatic organisms, ecosystem functions as well as land-water-interactions. Although monitoring of light pollution is routinely performed from space and supported by ground-based measurements, the extent and the amount of artificial light at night affecting water bodies is still largely unknown. This information, however, is essential for the design of future laboratory and field experiments, to guide light planners and to give recommendations for light pollution regulations. We analyze this knowledge gap by reviewing night-time light measurement techniques and discuss their current obstacles in the context of water bodies. We also provide an overview of light pollution studies in the aquatic context. Finally, we give recommendations on how comprehensive night-time light measurements in aquatic systems, specifically in freshwater systems, should be designed in the future.

  abstract = {The ventral visual pathway is crucially involved in integrating low-level visual features into complex representations for objects and scenes. At an intermediate stage of the ventral visual pathway, V4 plays a crucial role in supporting this transformation. Many V4 neurons are selective for shape segments like curves and corners; however, it remains unclear whether these neurons are organized into clustered functional domains, a structural motif common across other visual cortices. Using two-photon calcium imaging in awake macaques, we confirmed and localized cortical domains selective for curves or corners in V4. Single-cell resolution imaging confirmed that curve- or corner-selective neurons were spatially clustered into such domains. When tested with hexagonal-segment stimuli, we find that stimulus smoothness is the cardinal difference between curve and corner selectivity in V4. Combining cortical population responses with single-neuron analysis, our results reveal that curves and corners are encoded by neurons clustered into functional domains in V4. This functionally specific population architecture bridges the gap between the early and late cortices of the ventral pathway and may serve to facilitate complex object recognition.},

  abstract = {Color constancy is the perceived stability of the color of objects despite changes in the light illuminating them. An object's color is considered constant if the current perceived color is judged to be in accord with the remembered one. Thus the accuracy and precision of color memory are fundamental to understanding this classic problem. Two hypotheses of color memory are tested here: (1) the photoreceptor hypothesis, which states that the color recalled from memory reproduces the light absorbed by each type of cone and (2) the surface-reflectance hypothesis, which states that the color recalled from memory is based on an inferred spectral reflectance of a surface that does not depend on the spectral distribution of the illuminant. In the experiments a test color is surrounded by either (i) a complex pattern composed of several colored patches or (ii) a uniform ``gray'' field at the chromaticity of the illuminant. In a control condition the test color is presented on a dark background. Long-term memory of the test color is measured in a production task begun 10 min after the end of the learning phase. In general, the results with a complex surround are consistent with the surface-reflectance hypothesis but not with the photoreceptor hypothesis. Color memory with the ``gray'' surround, on the other hand, shows a much stronger effect of the illuminant used during learning. These results are consistent with computational models of color constancy that require three or more chromaticities in view.},

  abstract = {Light is an important factor in the conservation of museum collections because of its strong electromagnetic characteristic that can degrade artifacts. To investigate the effects of illumination on paintings, particularly in museums equipped with popular light emitting diode (LED) lamp systems, we investigated the fading process of traditional Korean pigments. We used four illumination conditions: a combination of high and low color rendering index (CRI) at two light temperatures of Tcold\,=\,5600\,K and Twarm\,=\,3200\,K. Among all samples tested, realgar, also known as Wunghwang in Korea, showed the most marked change in color. UV spectrometric analyses after 100\,h of exposure at 11 000 and at 5500\,lux showed high color differences exceeding the color change threshold under all illumination conditions. When the illumination intensity was reduced to 300\,lux, Tcold lamps showed a faster fading process than Twarm lamps did, suggesting that appropriate illuminating conditions can reduce the adverse effects of museum lighting systems. A further experiment using narrow-band, single-color, LED lamps showed how specific wavelength bands could influence the fading of artifacts In particular, we newly confirmed that discoloration of Wunghwang could be induced by the illumination of green light, in addition to blue light generally known to induce discoloration. These results demonstrate that the fading of a specific pigment of the artifacts in museum collections can be minimized by tuning the intensities of the wavelengths of light emitted by the museums' lighting systems.},

We then consider the psychophysical properties of cortical color vision and what they reveal about its use in determining shape and form. We pit against each other different models accounting for how achromatic (luminance) contrast and color contrast may be linked in the determination of shape, comparing a coloring book model, in which color plays only a subordinate or minor role, an intrinsic images model in which color contrast makes an independent contribution, and an integration model in which color and luminance contrast both provide cue-invariant form information to color\textendash luminance shape detectors. These models are also interpreted in the light of what we know about the physiological basis of color vision through primate single cell recordings, particularly in area V1. Finally, we discuss what has been revealed about human color vision in V1 and extra striate cortex from fMRI studies.},

  abstract = {To understand the role of primary visual cortex (V1) in color vision, we measured directly the input from the 3 cone types in macaque V1 neurons. Cells were classified as luminance-preferring, color-luminance, or color-preferring from the ratio of the peak amplitudes of spatial frequency responses to red/green equiluminant and to black/white (luminance) grating patterns, respectively. In this study we used L-, M-, and S-cone\textendash isolating gratings to measure spatial frequency response functions for each cone type separately. From peak responses to cone-isolating stimuli we estimated relative cone weights and whether cone inputs were the same or opposite sign. For most V1 cells the relative S-cone weight was {$<$}0.1. All color-preferring cells were cone opponent and their L/M cone weight ratio was clustered around a value of \textendash 1, which is roughly equal and opposite L and M cone signals. Almost all cells (88\%) classified as luminance cells were cone nonopponent, with a broad distribution of cone weights. Most cells (73\%) classified as color-luminance cells were cone opponent. This result supports our conclusion that V1 color-luminance cells are double-opponent. Such neurons are more sensitive to color boundaries than to areas of color and thereby could play an important role in color perception. The color-luminance population had a broad distribution of L/M cone weight ratios, implying a broad distribution of preferred colors for the double-opponent cells.},

The original ISA software suite provided a set of user-facing Java tools for creating and manipulating the information structured in ISA-Tab - a now widely used tabular format. To make the ISA framework more accessible to machines and enable programmatic manipulation of experiment metadata, a JSON serialization ISA-JSON was developed. Results: In this work, we present the ISA API, a Python library for the creation, editing, parsing, and validating of ISA-Tab and ISA-JSON formats by using a common data model engineered as Python class objects. We describe the ISA API feature set, early adopters and its growing user community. Conclusions: The ISA API provides users with rich programmatic metadata handling functionality to support automation, a common interface and an interoperable medium between the two ISA formats, as well as with other life science data formats required for depositing data in public databases.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {IN 1948 the German physicist, Manfred Richter, reported that colour vision has a seasonal variation1,2. For four colour-normal subjects, he found a sinusoidal variation in the proportion of red and green required to match a monochromatic yellow, the equation known as the 'Rayleigh match'3. In summer, subjects required more red in their mixture. The measurements were made with the Nagel anomaloscope, an instrument introduced in 19074,5 and which today, essentially unchanged, remains the definitive clinical instrument for classifying the many phenotypic variations in colour vision. The variation that Richter recorded in the red\textendash green ratio was large (three Nagel units), and it now takes on fresh interest because it is comparable in size to the difference in Nagel settings later reported between normal observers of different genetic types6,7. We have been able to replicate Richter's result, but report here that it is almost certainly instrumental: the Nagel anomaloscope proves to be very sensitive to ambient temperature.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Many languages express `blue' and `green' under an umbrella term `grue'. To explain this variation, it has been suggested that changes in eye physiology, due to UV-light incidence, can lead to abnormalities in blue-green color perception which causes the color lexicon to adapt. Here, we apply advanced statistics on a set of 142 populations to model how different factors shape the presence of a specific term for blue. In addition, we examined if the ontogenetic effect of UV-light on color perception generates a negative selection pressure against inherited abnormal red-green perception. We found the presence of a specific term for blue was influenced by UV incidence as well as several additional factors, including cultural complexity. Moreover, there was evidence that UV incidence was negatively related to abnormal red-green color perception. These results demonstrate that variation in languages can only be understood in the context of their cultural, biological, and physical environments.},

  abstract = {The CIE General Colour Rendering Index is currently the criterion used to describe and measure the colour-rendering properties of light sources. But over the past years, there has been increasing evidence of its limitations particularly its ability to predict the perceived colour quality of light sources and especially some LEDs. In this paper, several aspects of perceived colour quality are investigated using a side-by-side paired comparison method, and the following criteria: naturalness of fruits and vegetables, colourfulness of the Macbeth Color Checker chart, visual appreciation (attractiveness/ preference) and colour difference estimations for both visual scenes. Forty-five observers with normal colour vision evaluated nine light sources at 3000 K, and 36 observers evaluated eight light sources at 4000 K. Our results indicate that perceived colour differences are better dealt by the CIECAM02 Uniform Colour Space. Naturalness is better described by fidelity indices even if they did not give perfect predictions for all differences between LED light sources. Colourfulness is well described by gamut-based indices and attractiveness was found to correlate best with gamut-based indices but also with a preference index or a memory index calculated without blue and purple hues. A very low correlation was found between appreciation and naturalness indicating that colour quality needs more than one metric to describe subjective aspects.},

The temporal properties of intrinsic ipRGC signalling are distinct to those of rods and cones, including longer latencies and sustained signalling after light offset. We examined whether the melanopsin mediated post-illumination pupil response (PIPR) and pupil constriction were dependent upon the inter-stimulus interval (ISI) between successive light pulses and the temporal frequency of sinusoidal light stimuli. Melanopsin excitation was altered by variation of stimulus wavelength (464nm and 638nm lights) and irradiance (11.4 and 15.2logphotonscm-2s-1). We found that 6s PIPR amplitude was independent of ISI and temporal frequency for all melanopsin excitation levels, indicating complete summation. In contrast to the PIPR, the maximum pupil constriction increased with increasing ISI with high and low melanopsin excitation, but time to minimum diameter was slower with high melanopsin excitation only. This melanopsin response to briefly presented pulses (16 and 100ms) slows the temporal response of the maximum pupil constriction. We also demonstrate that high melanopsin excitation attenuates the phasic peak-trough pupil amplitude compared to conditions with low melanopsin excitation, indicating an interaction between inner and outer retinal inputs to the pupil light reflex. We infer that outer retina summation is important for rapidly controlling pupil diameter in response to short timescale fluctuations in illumination and may occur at two potential sites, one that is presynaptic to extrinsic photoreceptor input to ipRGCs, or another within the pupil control pathway if ipRGCs have differential temporal tuning to extrinsic and intrinsic signalling.},

  abstract = {Neural computations along the ventral visual stream, -- which culminates in the inferior temporal (IT) cortex -- enable humans and monkeys to recognize objects quickly. Primate IT is organized topographically: nearby neurons have similar response properties. Yet the best models of the ventral visual stream - deep artificial neural networks (ANNs) \textendash{} have ``IT'' layers that lack topography. We built Topographic Deep ANNs (TDANNs) by incorporating a proxy wiring cost alongside the standard ImageNet categorization cost in the two ``IT-like'' layers of AlexNet (Lee et al., 2018), by specifying that ``neurons'' that have similar response properties should be physically close to each other. This cost both induced topographic structure and altered tuning characteristics of model IT neurons. We presented 2560 naturalistic images to monkeys and to ANNs. We found that, relative to the base (nontopographic) model, the ``neurons'' in the ``IT'' layer of some of the TDANN models matched actual IT neurons slightly better, and the dimensionality of the TDANN ``IT'' neural population was much closer to that of the measured monkey IT neural population. We also found that, while TDANNs did not show a statistically significant better match to human object discrimination behavior, detailed analysis suggests a trend in that direction. Taken together, TDANNs may better capture properties of IT cortex and wiring costs might be the cause of topographic organization in primate IT.},

These pathways consist of ensembles or grids of ON and OFF detectors spanning sensory space. Yet, encoding by opponent pathways raises a question: How should grids of ON and OFF detectors be arranged to optimally encode natural stimuli? We investigated this question using a model of the retina guided by efficient coding theory. Specifically, we optimized spatial receptive fields and contrast response functions to encode natural images given noise and constrained firing rates. We find that the optimal arrangement of ON and OFF receptive fields exhibits a transition between aligned and antialigned grids. The preferred phase depends on detector noise and the statistical structure of the natural stimuli. These results reveal that noise and stimulus statistics produce qualitative shifts in neural coding strategies and provide theoretical predictions for the configuration of opponent pathways in the nervous system.},

  abstract = {Modern accounts of color appearance differ in whether they assume that the perceptual primaries (e.g., white and the unique hues of red, green, blue, and yellow) correspond to unique states determined by the spectral sensitivities of the observer or by the spectral statistics of the environment. We examined the interaction between observers and their environments by asking how color perception should vary if appearance depends on fixed responses in a set of color channels, when the sensitivities of these channels are adapted in plausible ways to different environments. Adaptation was modeled as gain changes in the cones and in multiple postreceptoral channels tuned to different directions in color\textendash luminance space. Gains were adjusted so that the average channel responses were equated across two environments or for the same environment during different seasons, based on sets of natural outdoor scenes (Webster et al., 2007). Because of adaptation, even observers with a shared underlying physiology should perceive color in significantly and systematically different ways when they are exposed to and thus adapted by different contexts. These include differences in achromatic settings (owing to variations in the average chromaticity of locations) and differences in perceived hue (because of differences in scene contrasts). Modeling these changes provides a way of simulating how colors might be experienced by individuals in different color environments and provides a measure of how much color appearance might be modulated for a given observer by variations in the environment.},

Such stimuli are uncharacteristic of natural images, and we examined whether visual discomfort more generally increases with deviations from the spatial and chromatic properties of natural scenes. Observers rated the level of discomfort or artistic merit in color images generated from noise or random overlapping rectangles (Mondrians). In one set, the slopes of the amplitude spectra for luminance or chromatic contrast were varied independently to create images ranging from strongly blurred to sharpened relative to a `natural' 1/f spectrum. Perceived blur was dominated by the luminance slopes, with discomfort rated lowest for \$ 1/f spectra. In a second set of focused Mondrians, color was varied along different axes in the L \^ M versus S \^ LM chromatic plane. Discomfort ratings were lowest around bluish \^ yellowish axes that are again typical of natural outdoor scenes. A final set varied in the levels of both luminance and chromatic contrast. Discomfort increased with increasing color contrast or decreasing luminance contrast, and tended toward lower ratings for images with balanced levels of luminance and color contrast. Notably, these ratings of discomfort were not related to judgments of artistic merit. Thus, for both spatial and chromatic content, the least aversive images corresponded to characteristic properties of the natural visual environment, and may reflect a normalization of visual coding to the natural world.},

Conclusions reached are as follows: (i) the spectra of colours in high spatial frequency patterns are often well designed to be very conspicuous to a colour vision system at close range but well camouflaged at a distance; (ii) blue and yellow, the most frequently used colours in reef fishes, may be good for camouflage or communication depending on the background they are viewed against; and (iii) reef fishes use a combination of colour and behaviour to regulate their conspicuousness and crypsis.},

  abstract = {The term ``cortical column'' has been used to identify a number of different types of subdivisions of cortical areas. Here we describe and discuss several of these types of modular subdivisions in cortex, and suggest criteria for distinguishing these types. Minicolumns are narrow, vertical arrays of densely interconnected neurons that cross all cortical layers, and may represent a basic computational unit that is common to all cortical areas across mammalian species. Other types of columns are more variable across cortical areas and mammalian species, and have different developmental and evolutionary functions and histories. Classical columns are so named because they correspond to the column type first described by Mountcastle (J Neurophysiol 20:408\textendash 434, PMID 13439410, 1957), and consist of larger alternating patches of cortex that span all cortical layers, and contain neurons that have different response properties from those of neurons in adjoining columns. Several types of classical columns have been identified, and evidence for more types will likely emerge with further investigation. Classical columns divide cortical areas into sets of functionally specialized modules. A third type of cortical subdivision, unbounded columns, collectively represent a continuously varied stimulus dimension, such as the orientation of a bar or line, across a cortical area. Thus, vertical rows of neurons across a patch of cortex representing a small portion of the visual field will vary continuously in the orientation of a stimulus bar that best activates them, and there are no obvious borders between rows of neurons that prefer one orientation and adjoining rows that prefer a slightly different orientation. Other continuously variable stimuli such as color are likely to be represented by unbounded columns as well. A fourth type of cortical column consists of adjoining blocks of neurons that represent different parts of the receptor surface. The ocular dominance columns in primary visual cortex constitute a well-known example, where blocks of neurons are activated preferentially by one eye or the other. The banded representation of digits in somatosensory cortex of monkeys and raccoons provide another example. Lastly, cortical areas are sometimes divided into specialized regions or domains that are distinct from one another and do not repeat across the cortical surface. Such domains appear to exist in motor and premotor cortex, posterior parietal cortex, and temporal visual cortex of primates. Finally, we address questions of how columns emerge in development, and how mechanisms for their development evolved. Clearly there are genetic factors, especially for those that control activity-dependent neural mechanisms of synapse formation and selection.},

  abstract = {It is well established that the adult brain contains a mosaic of domain-specific networks. But how do these domain-specific networks develop? Here we tested the hypothesis that the brain comes prewired with connections that precede the development of domain-specific function. Using resting-state fMRI in the youngest sample of newborn humans tested to date, we indeed found that cortical networks that will later develop strong face selectivity (including the ``proto'' occipital face area and fusiform face area) and scene selectivity (including the ``proto'' parahippocampal place area and retrosplenial complex) by adulthood, already show domain-specific patterns of functional connectivity as early as 27 d of age (beginning as early as 6 d of age). Furthermore, we asked how these networks are functionally connected to early visual cortex and found that the proto face network shows biased functional connectivity with foveal V1, while the proto scene network shows biased functional connectivity with peripheral V1. Given that faces are almost always experienced at the fovea, while scenes always extend across the entire periphery, these differential inputs may serve to facilitate domain-specific processing in each network after that function develops, or even guide the development of domain-specific function in each network in the first place. Taken together, these findings reveal domain-specific and eccentricity-biased connectivity in the earliest days of life, placing new constraints on our understanding of the origins of domain-specific cortical networks.},

  abstract = {Non-recurrent deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are currently the best at modeling core object recognition, a behavior that is supported by the densely recurrent primate ventral stream, culminating in the inferior temporal (IT) cortex. If recurrence is critical to this behavior, then primates should outperform feedforward-only deep CNNs for images that require additional recurrent processing beyond the feedforward IT response. Here we first used behavioral methods to discover hundreds of these `challenge' images. Second, using large-scale electrophysiology, we observed that behaviorally sufficient object identity solutions emerged \textasciitilde 30\,ms later in the IT cortex for challenge images compared with primate performance-matched `control' images. Third, these behaviorally critical late-phase IT response patterns were poorly predicted by feedforward deep CNN activations. Notably, very-deep CNNs and shallower recurrent CNNs better predicted these late IT responses, suggesting that there is a functional equivalence between additional nonlinear transformations and recurrence. Beyond arguing that recurrent circuits are critical for rapid object identification, our results provide strong constraints for future recurrent model development.},

The observed curves sorted themselves out in the order of haziness and the elevation of a curve above the curve calculated on the basis of molecular scattering could be taken as a measure of the haze. ({$\delta{'}$} - {$\delta{''}$}), obtained independently from direct sun observations, was another measure of haze and on plotting these two against each other, it was found that there was clear correlation between them.Another interesting fact observed was that as Z decreased from 90\textdegree{} to 0\textdegree, log I{${''}$}/I{${'}$} had first a rapid decrease, showed a minimum near about 45\textdegree{} and for still lower values of Z showed anincrease, the increase being rapid below 20\textdegree. Calculations of primary molecular scattering showed that the curve should steadily decrease with Z right down to Z=0\textdegree. These deviations from the calculated curve became less marked on clear days but were quite evident even with apparently very clear skies. On decomposing the observed curve into the molecular scattering curve and the curve of residue, it was seen that this residue curve indicated very large intensities at small angles from the direction of incidence, decreasing rapidly as the angle increased and could be reasonably attributed to scattering by large particles present in the atmosphere.},

  abstract = {Objective To weight the rod-, cone-, and melanopsin-mediated activation of the retinal ganglion cells, which drive the pupil light reflex by varying the light stimulus wavelength, intensity, and duration. Design Experimental study. Participants Forty-three subjects with normal eyes and 3 patients with neuroretinal visual loss. Methods A novel stimulus paradigm was developed using either a long wavelength (red) or short wavelength (blue) light given as a continuous Ganzfeld stimulus with stepwise increases over a 2 log-unit range. The pupillary movement before, during, and after the light stimulus was recorded in real time with an infrared illuminated video camera. Main Outcome Measures The percent pupil contraction of the transient and sustained pupil response to a low- (1 cd/m2), medium- (10 cd/m2), and high-intensity (100 cd/m2) red- and blue-light stimulus was calculated for 1 eye of each subject. From the 43 normal eyes, median and 25th, 75th, 5th, and 95th percentile values were obtained for each stimulus condition. Results In normal eyes at lower intensities, blue light evoked much greater pupil responses compared with red light when matched for photopic luminance. The transient pupil contraction was generally greater than the sustained contraction, and this disparity was greatest at the lowest light intensity and least apparent with bright (100 cd/m2) blue light. A patient with primarily rod dysfunction (nonrecordable scotopic electroretinogram) showed significantly reduced pupil responses to blue light at lower intensities. A patient with achromatopsia and an almost normal visual field showed selective reduction of the pupil response to red-light stimulation. A patient with ganglion cell dysfunction owing to anterior ischemic optic neuropathy demonstrated global loss of pupil responses to red and blue light in the affected eye. Conclusions Pupil responses that differ as a function of light intensity and wavelength support the hypothesis that selected stimulus conditions can produce pupil responses that reflect phototransduction primarily mediated by rods, cones, or melanopsin. Use of chromatic pupil responses may be a novel way to diagnose and monitor diseases affecting either the outer or inner retina.

  abstract = {THE LINGUISTIC SIGNIFICANCE OF THE MEANINGS OF BASIC COLOR TERMS Paul Kay and Chad K. McDaniel University of California, Berkeley There are semantic universals in the domain of color; i.e. there are constraints on the types of possible basic color lexicons. These constraints arise from the structure and function of the visual system. Thus in the case of color at least, rather than language determining perception (cf. Sapir and Whorf), it is perception that determines language. In deriving the semantic universals from properties of the visual system, one must employ a continuous rather than discrete mathematics, in particular the theory of fuzzy sets. The resulting model of color semantics thus conflicts with the discretefeature concept of semantic primes shared by structuralists and generativists. It is argued on this basis that discrete-feature semantic theories are of limited accuracy.* Introduction 1. Recent empirical research into the meanings of words for color provides evidence that contradicts two widely-held beliefs in linguistics and the philosophy of language. This paper presents a summary of this evidence, uses it as a basis to construct a general model of basic color-term semantics, and explores the implications of this model for general semantic theory. The first belief against which we will present evidence is familiar to most linguists as the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis. There are various so-called strong and weak forms of this hypothesis (Fishman 1960); in all forms, the basic notion is that each language imposes on the individual's 'kaleidoscopic flux of impressions' its own idiosyncratic semantic structure. This doctrine emphasizes the relativity of semantic structures, and minimizes the role oflinguistic universals. The lexical categorization of color has often been presented as a paradigmatic instance of this arbitrary, language-specific imposition of semantic structure. Thus, in his widely-used introductory textbook, Gleason claimed (1961 :4), 'There is a continuous gradation of color from one end of the spectrum to the other. Yet an American describing it will list the hues as red, orange, yellow, green, blue, purple\textemdash or something of the kind. There is nothing inherent either in the spectrum or the human perception of it which would compel its division in this way.' Studying 20 languages experimentally and investigating the literature on colorterm semantics for 78 additional languages, Berlin \& Kay 1969 (hereafter B \& K) presented evidence indicating that, contrary to the claims of Gleason and others, all languages share a universal system of basic color categorization. B \& K argued that there are universal basic color categories, and that the basic color-term inventories of most languages expand through time by lexicalizing these categories in a highly constrained, universal order. In addition, McDaniel has argued (1972, 1974, ms) that these universals are inherent in the human perception of color. The * We have benefited greatly regarding the matters discussed here from the ideas of John Atkins, Brent Berlin, Janet Dougherty, Craig Molgaard, Sue Thompson, Bill Wootcn, and an anonymous reader for Language named George Lakoff. 610 LINGUISTIC SIGNIFICANCE OF MEANINGS OF BASIC COLOR TERMS 611 color perception of all peoples is the result of a common set of neurophysiological processes, and McDaniel suggests that these pan-human neurophysiological processes are the basis of the universal patterns in the meanings of basic color terms. We argue, then, in direct opposition to Gleason and other relativists, that the human perception of color offers an explanation of why English speakers segment the visual spectrum as they do\textemdash and why, furthermore, speakers of other languages exhibit the limited and systematic set ofalternative segmentations ofthe color space that they do. Working with a biologically based understanding of basic color-term semantics, we can show the natural relations that exist between the numerous color categories encoded in highly differentiated color terminologies, such as English, and the fewer categories encoded in languages with less differentiated and therefore superficially simpler terminologies. Thus, in extension of the arguments advanced by B \& K, we present the lexical categorization of color as a paradigmatic example, not ofthe relativity of semantic structures, but ofthe existence of biologically based semantic universals. A second widespread belief in linguistics and the philosophy of language, challenged by the data reviewed here, is the doctrine that there exist ultimate semantic primes which are discrete...}

  abstract = {Many animals use the spectral distribution of light to guide behaviour, but whether they have colour vision has been debated for over a century. Our strong subjective experience of colour and the fact that human vision is the paradigm for colour science inevitably raises the question of how we compare with other species. This article outlines four grades of `colour vision' that can be related to the behavioural uses of spectral information, and perhaps to the underlying mechanisms. In the first, even without an (image-forming) eye, simple organisms can compare photoreceptor signals to locate a desired light environment. At the next grade, chromatic mechanisms along with spatial vision guide innate preferences for objects such as food or mates; this is sometimes described as wavelength-specific behaviour. Here, we compare the capabilities of di- and trichromatic vision, and ask why some animals have more than three spectral types of receptors. Behaviours guided by innate preferences are then distinguished from a grade that allows learning, in part because the ability to learn an arbitrary colour is evidence for a neural representation of colour. The fourth grade concerns colour appearance rather than colour difference: for instance, the distinction between hue and saturation, and colour categorization. These higher-level phenomena are essential to human colour perception but poorly known in animals, and we suggest how they can be studied. Finally, we observe that awareness of colour and colour qualia cannot be easily tested in animals.},

  abstract = {Category rating is a procedure commonly used to evaluate visual discomfort due to glare. One recommended step for good practise in a category rating procedure is to use a pre-trial demonstration (PTD) of the range of stimuli to be experienced. However, PTD have rarely, if at all, been used in past research on discomfort glare. In this study, two experiments were conducted to test the influence of the PTD on evaluations of discomfort due to glare. In the first experiment participants evaluated four glare source luminances with, and without, a PTD. The results suggest that using a PTD increased the reported degree of discomfort perceived for the same glare setting, although this may depend on the manner in which the PTD is presented. In the second experiment, participants evaluated four glare source luminances using PTD with three different luminance ranges: the results suggest this had significant effect on discomfort evaluations in that evaluations of discomfort were lower when a higher luminance range was used. Along with other recent studies, these findings suggest a need to derive a more robust procedure for measuring the discomfort due to glare.},

Research Design: The expectations of decision maker and visitor stakeholders were determined via a survey of 130 decision makers (museum personnel and designers) and 427 museum visitors. Problems associated with existing conditions were assessed via a comprehensive evaluation using instrument-based lighting measures applied in 39 electrically-lit and daylit galleries (rooms) in 22 U.S. museums. Mismatches between expectations and existing exhibition lighting conditions were summarized. Analysis: Factor analysis was used to consolidate the data. The Friedman test was applied to determine significant differences between mean factor responses. Key Findings: Decision makers and visitors have different expectations. Neither group's priority expectations are met in existing conditions. The major problem among decision makers is daylight management for artifact preservation in daylit galleries. The major problem for visitors is artifact appearance and visibility. Conclusions: Successful design depends on informed decision making, which must be based on documented evidence, not speculation, and should address stakeholders' expectations and field performance problems. Prioritized design recommendations are given.},

  abstract = {Little scientific evidence is available to document the state of museum exhibition lighting regarding occupant and decision maker needs or the mismatches (disparities) between needs and "reality" which exist in actual settings. Without knowledge of constituent needs or of the existing situation, decision making is ineffective and improvement is unlikely. Building diagnostics provides a framework for this project. The diagnostic process serves as an essential link in more closely matching building performance stated needs with "reality" (perceived and existing physical conditions). This work provides the essential research base for architectural decision making and formulation of appropriate strategies to improve museum lighting performance. First, needs of various constituencies are determined, then the problems associated with perceived and instrument measured "reality" are identified, and finally the mismatches between need and "reality" are highlighted. The study included a survey of 130 museum personnel and lighting designers and 427 museum visitors to determine the needs of these constituencies. The current status of exhibition lighting was assessed via a comprehensive evaluation using both objective (instrument-based) and subjective measures of lighting performance in 39 electrically-lit and daylit galleries from 22 museums throughout the United States. Appropriate univariate and multivariate statistical techniques were used to consolidate the data. Analysis of this sample revealed that the important stated needs of decision makers and visitors were not met in "reality". The major decision maker mismatch was daylight management as related to artifact preservation in daylit galleries and the major visitor mismatch was artifact appearance in electrically-lit galleries. Study results suggest the limited resources available should be directed toward minimizing glare, enhancing artifact appearance in terms of color richness and detail visibility, and improving the effectiveness of daylight management to protect artifacts as related to illuminance and relative humidity. Specific improvement strategies are identified.},

In this paper, a measurement method and an instrument (the multidirectional spectroradiometer \textendash{} MuS) is proposed, which considers different light incidents and spectra simultaneously, therefore, enables measurement of light characteristics relevant for non-image-forming effects. The MuS consists of four spectroradiometers measuring in different directions. Four spectrometers using optical fibers were configured to measure the spectral irradiance within a wavelength range from 200 to 1100 nm with 5.7 nm pixel resolution. Application of the MuS facilitates a better understanding of the non-image-forming light characteristics of spaces. The MuS is tested with stable electric lighting and with dynamic daylight conditions and is proven reliable to perform continuous spectral measurements in different directions simultaneously. Results show a substantial difference in measured radiation magnitude and spectral distribution in different directions, which suggests varying impact on non-image-forming effects.},

Reflectance reconstruction from multispectral image data is typically based on certain assumptions. One of the common assumptions is that the same illumination is used for system calibration and image acquisition. The authors propose the concept of multispectral constancy which transforms the captured sensor data into an illuminant-independent representation, analogously to the concept of computational color constancy. They propose to transform the multispectral image data to a canonical representation through spectral adaptation transform (SAT). The performance of such a transform is tested on measured reflectance spectra and hyperspectral reflectance images. The authors also investigate the robustness of the transform to the inaccuracy of illuminant estimation in natural scenes. Results of reflectance reconstruction show that the proposed SAT is efficient and is robust to error in illuminant estimation. c 2018 Society for Imaging Science and Technology.},

  abstract = {After its discovery in 1990, blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) contrast in functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) has been widely used to map brain activation in humans and animals. Since fMRI relies on signal changes induced by neural activity, its signal source can be complex and is also dependent on imaging parameters and techniques. In this review, we identify and describe the origins of BOLD fMRI signals, including the topics of (1) effects of spin density, volume fraction, inflow, perfusion, and susceptibility as potential contributors to BOLD fMRI, (2) intravascular and extravascular contributions to conventional gradient-echo and spin-echo BOLD fMRI, (3) spatial specificity of hemodynamic-based fMRI related to vascular architecture and intrinsic hemodynamic responses, (4) BOLD signal contributions from functional changes in cerebral blood flow (CBF), cerebral blood volume (CBV), and cerebral metabolic rate of O2 utilization (CMRO2), (5) dynamic responses of BOLD, CBF, CMRO2, and arterial and venous CBV, (6) potential sources of initial BOLD dips, poststimulus BOLD undershoots, and prolonged negative BOLD fMRI signals, (7) dependence of stimulus-evoked BOLD signals on baseline physiology, and (8) basis of resting-state BOLD fluctuations. These discussions are highly relevant to interpreting BOLD fMRI signals as physiological means.},

  abstract = {The Old World macaque monkey and New World common marmoset provide fundamental models for human visual processing, yet the human ancestral lineage diverged from these monkey lineages over 25 Mya. We therefore asked whether fine-scale synaptic wiring in the nervous system is preserved across these three primate families, despite long periods of independent evolution. We applied connectomic electron microscopy to the specialized foveal retina where circuits for highest acuity and color vision reside. Synaptic motifs arising from the cone photoreceptor type sensitive to short (S) wavelengths and associated with ``blue\textendash yellow'' (S-ON and S-OFF) color-coding circuitry were reconstructed. We found that distinctive circuitry arises from S cones for each of the three species. The S cones contacted neighboring L and M (long- and middle-wavelength sensitive) cones in humans, but such contacts were rare or absent in macaques and marmosets. We discovered a major S-OFF pathway in the human retina and established its absence in marmosets. Further, the S-ON and S-OFF chromatic pathways make excitatory-type synaptic contacts with L and M cone types in humans, but not in macaques or marmosets. Our results predict that early-stage chromatic signals are distinct in the human retina and imply that solving the human connectome at the nanoscale level of synaptic wiring will be critical for fully understanding the neural basis of human color vision.},

However, due to the multiple imaging processes that product photos undergo, end-users often experience a color mismatch between the color of the photo online and the product received. Therefore, we use a crowdsourcing approach to generate what we term CrowdColor, which is the collective color reported by individuals using a mobile color picker. CrowdColor serves as a color review application from the customers' perspectives in the form of a color palette that represents the product color. We perform controlled experiments to evaluate the accuracy of CrowdColor and to understand how the effects of the device and lighting conditions may influence the crowd's color perception and input tasks. The quantitative results reveal that CrowdColor achieves high accuracy and is positively rated overall. Based on experimental analyses, we present design guidelines for crowdsourcing color perception tasks.},

  abstract = {Estimating local surface orientation (slant and tilt) is fundamental to recovering the three-dimensional structure of the environment, but it is unknown how well humans perform this task in natural scenes. Here, with a high-fidelity database of natural stereo-images with groundtruth surface orientation at each pixel, we find dramatic differences in human tilt estimation with natural and artificial stimuli. With artificial stimuli, estimates are precise and unbiased. With natural stimuli, estimates are imprecise and strongly biased. An image-computable normative model grounded in natural scene statistics predicts human bias, precision, and trial-by-trial errors without fitting parameters to the human data. These similarities suggest that the complex human performance patterns with natural stimuli are lawful, and that human visual systems have internalized local image and scene statistics to optimally infer the three-dimensional structure of the environment. The current results help generalize our understanding of human vision from the lab to the real world.},

Contrary to this intuition, we find that blind and sighted adults share causal understanding of color, despite not always agreeing about arbitrary color facts. Relative to sighted people, blind individuals are less likely to generate ``yellow'' for banana and ``red'' for stop sign but make similar generative inferences about real and novel objects' colors, and provide similar causal explanations. For example, people infer that two natural kinds (e.g., bananas) and two artifacts with functional colors (e.g., stop signs) are more likely to have the same color than two artifacts with nonfunctional colors (e.g., cars). People develop intuitive and inferentially rich ``theories'' of color regardless of visual experience. Linguistic communication is more effective at aligning intuitive theories than knowledge of arbitrary facts.},

Melatonin, which affects human circadian rhythms, is sensitive to blue wavelength region of light. We have investigated the spectroscopic effects of light from virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) display devices on non-visual characteristics by means of an analysis of the spectral power distribution (SPD). The circadian illuminance (CIL) and melatonin suppression value (MSV) were introduced as representative figures of merits for spectroscopically evaluating non-visual characteristics. A VR/AR-like custom-made instrument was used to study how the SPD of the display light source affects non-visual characteristics. Moreover, using multilayer thin-film filters, optimal conditions for minimizing the change of the visual color characteristics of the display while reducing the influence on the non-visual characteristics are also discussed. For the AR device, we found that its spectrum was mostly affected by external light rather than by the spectrum of the AR display itself.},

These norms are presented as actual values (TES) and also as square root values ({$\surd$}TES). Other data include partial error scores for red-green and blue-yellow axes discrimination. Conclusion: This study provides the most detailed set of normative data to date. The data are also in agreement with other reports of chromatic discrimination, showing that the performance in this task varies as a U-shape function with age, the best being achieved at 19 years of age.},

After measuring each cell's spatial and temporal properties, we performed several tests of its chromatic properties using sine-wave gratings modulated around a mean gray background. Most cells behaved like neurons in area V1 and their responses were adequately described by a model that assumes a linear combination of cone signals. Unlike in V1, we found a subpopulation of cells whose activity was increased or inhibited by stimuli within a narrow range of color combinations. No particular color directions were preferentially represented. V2 cells showing color specificity, including cells showing narrow chromatic tuning, were present in any of the stripe compartments, as defined by cytochrome-oxidase (CO) staining. An addition of chromatic contrast facilitated the responses of most neurons to gratings with various luminance contrasts. Neurons in all three CO compartments gave significant responses to isoluminant gratings. Receptive-field properties of cells were generally similar for luminance and chromatically defined stimuli. We found only a small number of cells with a clearly identifiable double-opponent receptive-field organization.},

Traditional methods for neural system identification do not capitalize on this separation of 'what' and 'where'. Learning deep convolutional feature spaces that are shared among many neurons provides an exciting path forward, but the architectural design needs to account for data limitations: While new experimental techniques enable recordings from thousands of neurons, experimental time is limited so that one can sample only a small fraction of each neuron's response space. Here, we show that a major bottleneck for fitting convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to neural data is the estimation of the individual receptive field locations, a problem that has been scratched only at the surface thus far. We propose a CNN architecture with a sparse readout layer factorizing the spatial (where) and feature (what) dimensions. Our network scales well to thousands of neurons and short recordings and can be trained end-to-end. We evaluate this architecture on ground-truth data to explore the challenges and limitations of CNN-based system identification. Moreover, we show that our network model outperforms current state-of-the art system identification models of mouse primary visual cortex.},

  abstract = {Brain perturbation studies allow detailed causal inferences of behavioral and neural processes. Because the combination of brain perturbation methods and neural measurement techniques is inherently challenging, research in humans has predominantly focused on non-invasive, indirect brain perturbations, or neurological lesions. Non-human primates have been indispensable as a neurobiological system that is highly similar to humans while simultaneously being more experimentally tractable, allowing visualization of the functional and structural impact of systematic brain perturbation. This review considers the state-of-the-art in non-human primate brain perturbation with a focus on approaches that can be combined with neuroimaging. We consider both non-reversible (lesions) and reversible or temporary perturbations such as electrical, pharmacological, optical, optogenetic, chemogenetic, pathway-selective, and ultrasound based interference methods. Method-specific considerations from the research and development community are offered to facilitate research in this field and support further innovations. We conclude by identifying novel avenues for further research and innovation and by highlighting the clinical translational potential of the methods.}

Feedforward and feedback connections propagate information between areas in opposite directions, but their functional roles are only partially understood. We used electrical microstimulation to perturb the propagation of neuronal activity between areas V1 and V4 in monkeys performing a texture-segregation task. In both areas, microstimulation locally caused a brief phase of excitation, followed by inhibition. Both these effects propagated faithfully in the feedforward direction from V1 to V4. Stimulation of V4, however, caused little V1 excitation, but it did yield a delayed suppression during the late phase of visually driven activity. This suppression was pronounced for the V1 figure representation and weaker for background representations. Our results reveal functional differences between feedforward and feedback processing in texture segregation and suggest a specific modulating role for feedback connections in perceptual organization.},

  abstract = {1. To infer relative roles of cortical areas at different stages of the ventral visual pathway, we quantitatively examined visual responses of cells in V2, V4, the posterior part of the inferotemporal cortex (posterior IT), and the anterior part of the inferotemporal cortex (anterior IT), using anesthetized macaque monkeys. 2. The critical feature for the activation was first determined for each recorded cell by using a reduction method. We started from images of three-dimensional complex objects and simplified the image of effective stimuli step by step by eliminating a part of the features present in the image. The simplest feature that maximally activated the cell was determined as the critical feature. The response to the critical feature was then compared with responses of the same cell to a routine set of 32 simple stimuli, which included white and black bars of four different orientations and squares or spots of four different colors. 3. Cells that responded maximally to particular complex object features were found in posterior IT and V4 as well as in anterior IT. The cells in posterior IT and V4 were, however, different from the cells in anterior IT in that many of them responded to some extent to some simple features, that the size of the receptive field was small, and that they intermingled in single penetrations with cells that responded maximally to some simple features. The complex critical features in posterior IT and V4 varied; they consisted of complex shapes, combinations of a shape and texture, and combinations of a shape and color. 4. We suggest that local neuronal networks in V4 and posterior IT play an essential role in the formation of selective responses to complex object features.},

This common structure is due to the visual system rather than to the statistics of environmental structure. Analysis involves an investigation of the proper sample space of spectral reflectance factors and of the statistical consequences of the projection of spectral reflectances on the color solid. Even in the case of reflectance statistics that are translationally invariant with respect to the wavelength dimension, the statistics of object colors is highly non-uniform. The qualitative nature of this non-uniformity is due to trichromacy.},

  abstract = {Categorization and fine discrimination are two different functions in visual perception, and we can switch between these two functions depending on the situation or task demands. To explore how visual cortical neurons behave in such situations, we recorded the activities of color-selective neurons in the inferior temporal (IT) cortex of two monkeys trained to perform a color categorization task, a color discrimination task and a simple fixation task. Many IT neurons changed their activity depending upon the task, although color selectivity was well conserved. A majority of neurons showed stronger responses during the categorization task. Moreover, for the population of IT neurons as a whole, signals contributing to performing the categorization task were enhanced. These results imply that judgment of color category by color-selective IT neurons is facilitated during the categorization task and suppressed during the discrimination task as a consequence of task-dependent modulation of their activities.},

  abstract = {We tested the color selectivity of neurons in the inferior temporal (IT) cortex of two awake macaque monkeys. A color stimulus was presented at the center of the visual field while the animal performed a fixation task. The responses of single units to various colors were recorded and were plotted in a color space. The color space was based on the CIE (Commission Internationale de l'Eclairage) chromaticity diagram. Quantitative analysis of the color selectivity was performed using a standard set of colors that were evenly distributed in the color space. Sixty-five neurons recorded from eight guide tubes implanted in anterior part of IT cortex were tested quantitatively, and their color selectivity was statistically evaluated. Forty-six of them (71\%) were classified as color selective. Color-selective cells responded to some colors but not to others, and we called the responsive region in the color space the ``color field.'' The location and the size of a cell's color field were largely independent of the luminance of the stimulus. About 80\% of the color-selective neurons had color fields consisting of a single responsive region that were restricted in some part of the color space, and the remaining cells had more than one responsive region within the color space. Preferred hues of the color-selective neurons differed from cell to cell. The population of cells together covered nearly all of the color space. There was a tendency for more color-selective cells to be less sensitive to white and desaturated cyans. Some of the cells with color fields that consisted of more than one responsive region were more sensitive to saturation of the stimulus than to its hue. Although previous electrophysiological studies in IT cortex emphasized the pattern selectivity of the neurons, our results suggest that color is an important factor in the role that IT cortex plays in the object recognition.},

  abstract = {Increasingly, policies are being introduced to reward and recognise open research practices, while the adoption of such practices into research routines is being facilitated by many grassroots initiatives. However, despite this widespread endorsement and support, open research is yet to be widely adopted, with early career researchers being the notable exception. For open research to become the norm, initiatives should engage academics from all career stages, particularly senior academics (namely senior lecturers, readers, professors) given their routine involvement in determining the quality of research. Senior academics, however, face unique challenges in implementing policy change and supporting grassroots initiatives. Given that - like all researchers - senior academics are in part motivated by self-interest, this paper lays out three feasible steps that senior academics can take to improve the quality and productivity of their research, that also serve to engender open research. These steps include a) change hiring criteria, b) change how scholarly outputs are credited, and c) change to funding and publishing with open research. The guidance we provide is accompanied by live, crowd-sourced material for further reading.},

  abstract = {Animal photoreceptor cells can be classified into two distinct types, depending on whether the photopigment is borne on the membrane of a modified cilium (ciliary type) or apical microvilli (rhabdomeric type) [1]. Ciliary photoreceptors are well known as vertebrate rods and cones and are also found in several invertebrates. The rhabdomeric photoreceptor, in contrast, is a predominant type of invertebrate visual cell, but morphologically identifiable rhabdomeric photoreceptors have never been found in vertebrates. It is hypothesized that the rhabdomeric photoreceptor cell had evolved to be the photosensitive retinal ganglion cell for the vertebrate circadian photoentrainment [2, 3, 4] owing to the fact that some molecules involved in cell differentiation are common among them [5]. We focused on the cephalochordate amphioxus because it is the closest living invertebrate to the vertebrates, and interestingly, it has rhabdomeric photoreceptor cells for putative nonvisual functions [6]. Here, we show that the amphioxus homolog of melanopsin [7, 8, 9], the circadian photopigment in the photosensitive retinal ganglion cells of vertebrates, is expressed in the rhabdomeric photoreceptor cells of the amphioxus and that its biochemical and photochemical properties, not just its primary structure, are considerably similar to those of the visual rhodopsins in the rhabdomeric photoreceptor cells of higher invertebrates. The cephalochordate rhabdomeric photoreceptor represents an evolutionary link between the invertebrate visual photoreceptor and the vertebrate circadian photoreceptor.},

These approaches are coupled with a deep-seated, often tacit, belief in the reductionist program for understanding the link between the brain and behavior. The aim of this program is causal explanation through neural manipulations that allow testing of necessity and sufficiency claims. We argue, however, that another equally important approach seeks an alternative form of understanding through careful theoretical and experimental decomposition of behavior. Specifically, the detailed analysis of tasks and of the behavior they elicit is best suited for discovering component processes and their underlying algorithms. In most cases, we argue that study of the neural implementation of behavior is best investigated after such behavioral work. Thus, we advocate a more pluralistic notion of neuroscience when it comes to the brain-behavior relationship: behavioral work provides understanding, whereas neural interventions test causality.},

For example, thresholds for detecting reddish and greenish changes from white are raised following viewing a field varying in a reddishgreenish direction, but not after viewing one varying in a yellowish-bluish direction. Similarly thresholds for yellowish and bluish changes from white are raised following viewing a field varying along a yellowish-bluish axis but are not altered by exposure to reddish-greenish variation. Thresholds for chromatic changes are not raised following viewing a field varying in luminance. Thresholds for changes in luminance are raised following viewing a field varying in luminance but not altered by exposure to purely chromatic variation. Since this selectivity is found only for these directions and not intermediate directions in color space we conclude that these directions are cardinal, that is, signals varying along these directions are carried along separate, fatiguable, second stage pathways. The results conform to the expectations of opponent process theory with the important exception that the yellowish-bluish cardinal direction is a tritanopic confusion line and not a red-green equilibrium line.},

  abstract = {We have measured color discrimination in the isoluminant plane under rigorously controlled adaptation conditions. Two regimes were studied. Under the first regime the observer was adapted to the region of color space in which the discriminations were made. Thresholds for detecting changes along the S - (L + M) axis are a linearly increasing function of the excitation of the S cones. Thresholds for detecting changes along the L - M axis are independent of the locus of adaptation along this axis. The straightness of these functions is inconsistent with the theory that second stage mechanisms are more sensitive in the middle of their operating ranges. No convincing evidence of interactions in the effects of adaptation locus or test stimuli was observed. Under the second regime the observer was adapted to one point in color space and the stimuli to be discriminated were located in other places in color space. Discrimination seems to be limited primarily by mechanisms maximally sensitive to modulation along the isoluminant cardinal axes but evidence suggestive of the operation of higher order mechanisms was also found.},

According to him, this internal knowledge is the legacy of a process of internalization; a process of natural selection over the evolutionary history of the species. Shepard has developed his proposal most fully in his analysis of the relation between kinematic geometry and the shape of the motion path in apparent motion displays. We argue that Shepard has made a case for applying the principles of kinematic geometry to the perception of motion, but that he has not made the case for injecting these principles into the mind of the percipient. We offer a more modest interpretation of his important findings: that kinematic geometry may be a model of apparent motion. Inasmuch as our recommended interpretation does not lodge geometry in the mind of the percipient, the motivation of positing internalization, a process that moves kinematic geometry into the mind, is obviated. In our conclusion, we suggest that cognitive psychologists, in their embrace of internal mental universals and internalization may have been seduced by the siren call of metaphor.},

  abstract = {Since antiquity, people have searched for a way to understand the colors we see\textemdash what they are, how many there are, and how they can be systematically identified and arranged in some kind of order. How to order colors is not merely a philosophical question, it also has many practical applications in art, design, and commerce. Our intense interest in color and its myriad practical applications have led people throughout history to develop many systems to characterize and order it. The number of color order systems developed throughout history is unknown but ranges in the hundreds. Many are no longer used, but continue to be of historical interest. Despite wrong turns and slow progress, our understanding of color and its order has improved steadily. Although full understanding continues to elude us, it seems clear that it will ultimately come from research in neurobiology, perception, and consciousness. This book is a compendium of 165 systems, dating from antiquity to the present. In it, the chapters present a history and categorization of color systems, describe each one using original figures and schematic drawings, and provide reviews of the underlying theory. Included are a brief overview of color vision and a synthesis of the various systems.},

  abstract = {The relationship between the information the visual system gathers at its interface with the outside world and the perceptual reality of four primary hues and the resulting hue circle has been and remains of interest since the second half of the 19th century. Considerable effort has been expended over many decades in determining statistical mean choices of color stimuli that for individuals represent unique hues in given conditions of viewing. In this article, historical and recent data are used to show the present state of knowledge. To have a means of comparison, in this article spectral and display unit stimuli are converted to Munsell hues on basis of dominant or complementary wavelengths of highest chroma data. Relatively good agreement was found between spectral and color sample data, with display data being significantly different in case of unique green. The issue of significant interobserver variability found in all data and its implications are highlighted. Problems with generating simple psychophysical models, particularly related to unique red, are discussed and a brief survey of the current knowledge on neural processing that may lead to unique hue perception is presented. Data still required for a meaningful definition of mean unique hue stimulus data are listed. \textcopyright{} 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

When illumination changes the stimulus luminance (reflectance), lightness constancy is weak and matching is dictated by object/background luminance contrast. When this contrast is masked or disrupted, lightness constancy mechanisms are more prominent. Thus von Kries adaptation is incompatible with lightness constancy, suggesting that cortical mechanisms must underlie color constancy, as expected from neurophysiological studies [Zeki, Nature 284, 412 (1980); Wild, Nature 313, 133 (1985)].},

  abstract = {Cell autonomous circadian clocks are ubiquitous. They coordinate with each other and relate to a more centralized `master' clock. Between taxonomic groups, the `master' clock significantly varies in its location and structure from a decentralized organization in Drosophila and zebrafish, to an interacting circuitry of circadian oscillators in the retina, pineal gland and hypothalamus in non-mammalian vertebrates, and a centralized hypothalamic clock in the suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN) of mammals. Endogenous clocks are synchronized directly or indirectly by cyclicity in the environment, e.g. daily cycles of light and darkness, temperature, food availability and social cues, and control daily rhythms in the behaviour and physiology of animals. These clocks keep time by molecular processes that are organized in an autoregulatory transcriptional-translational feedback loop (TTFL), which has been found evolutionarily conserved. TTFL comprises of gene sets functionally arranged in the positive, negative and accessory molecular loops. There is genetic transcription of `clock genes' and post-translation activities of the ``clock proteins'' with a time lag which defines the time. However, how TTFL maintains circa 24\,hour temporal programs is still not well understood.},

Each colour was assessed by a panel of five observers using a magnitude estimation method under three light sources, D65, TL84, and A. In total, 10,770 estimations were made, and these form a set of new colour appearance data in textiles. Data analysis was carried out and shows that the accuracy of the visual results for different observers is quite good. the colour appearance data were used to test the performance of seven chromatic-adaptation transformations, i.e., BFD, Bartleson, von Kries, CIE, Hunt, CIEL*a*b*, and Fairchild. the results show that the BFD transformation gives the most accurate prediction to the visual results between all transformations studied. All transformations can have a better fit to the experimental grid under TL84 than that under A. However, the results given by the best chromatic-adaptation transformation are still unsatisfied in colour industries, especially in the textile industry. the two sets of experimental grids respectively derived from this work and by Luo et al. (1991) were also studied. an expected difference between the two sets of experimental grids was found. the difference may mainly result from two factors: the experimental method in assessment and the size of the samples. \textcopyright{} 1995 John Wiley \& Sons, Inc.},

  abstract = {Visual performance depends on polar angle, even when eccentricity is held constant; on many psychophysical tasks observers perform best when stimuli are presented on the horizontal meridian, worst on the upper vertical, and intermediate on the lower vertical meridian. This variation in performance `around' the visual field can be as pronounced as that of doubling the stimulus eccentricity. The causes of these asymmetries in performance are largely unknown. Some factors in the eye, e.g. cone density, are positively correlated with the reported variations in visual performance with polar angle. However, the question remains whether these correlations can quantitatively explain the perceptual differences observed `around' the visual field. To investigate the extent to which the earliest stages of vision\textendash optical quality and cone density\textendash contribute to performance differences with polar angle, we created a computational observer model. The model uses the open-source software package ISETBIO to simulate an orientation discrimination task for which visual performance differs with polar angle. The model starts from the photons emitted by a display, which pass through simulated human optics with fixational eye movements, followed by cone isomerizations in the retina. Finally, we classify stimulus orientation using a support vector machine to learn a linear classifier on the photon absorptions. To account for the 30\% increase in contrast thresholds for upper vertical compared to horizontal meridian, as observed psychophysically on the same task, our computational observer model would require either an increase of \textasciitilde 7 diopters of defocus or a reduction of 500\% in cone density. These values far exceed the actual variations as a function of polar angle observed in human eyes. Therefore, we conclude that these factors in the eye only account for a small fraction of differences in visual performance with polar angle. Substantial additional asymmetries must arise in later retinal and/or cortical processing.},

This investigation measured the loci of achromatic points for various intensities of a test field presented in a real rather than a simulated environment, lit by illuminants of various chromaticities. The achromatic point varied markedly with the intensity level of the test field: for dim test fields it was close to the surround chromaticity, but for high luminance test fields it was almost invariant with the surround chromaticity. The varying achromatic settings imply a variation in the relative effectiveness of the different cone types, but this variation originates in the postreceptoral system rather than at the photoreceptors themselves: flicker photometric sensitivity was almost independent of the illuminant in all cases. Nor does the variation take the simple form of a sensitivity-scaling coefficient; such a model can not predict the observed dependence of the achromatic setting on test intensity. The data could, however, be modeled with a scheme in which the log of the relative cone weight implicit in the achromatic setting depends almost linearly on (1) the log of the relative cone excitation by the illuminant and (2) the log of the test field intensity.},

We hypothesize that WM representations are abstractions of low-level perceptual features. However, the neural nature of these putative abstract representations has thus far remained impenetrable. Here, we demonstrate that distinct visual stimuli (oriented gratings and moving dots) are flexibly recoded into the same WM format in visual and parietal cortices when that representation is useful for memory-guided behavior. Specifically, the behaviorally relevant features of the stimuli (orientation and direction) were extracted and recoded into a shared mnemonic format that takes the form of an abstract line-like pattern. We conclude that mnemonic representations are abstractions of percepts that are more efficient than and proximal to the behaviors they guide.},

Because cardiac pulse leads the subtle color change of a skin, a pulsatile signal which can be described as photoplethysmographic (PPG) signal can be measured through recording facial video using a digital camera. In this paper, we explore the potential that the reliable heart rate can be measured remotely by the facial video recorded using smartphone camera. First, using the front facing-camera of a smartphone, facial video was recorded. We detected facial region on the image of each frame using face detection, and yielded the raw trace signal from the green channel of the image. To extract more accurate cardiac pulse signal, we applied independent component analysis (ICA) to the raw trace signal. The heart rate was extracted using frequency analysis of the raw trace signal and the analyzed signal from ICA. The accuracy of the estimated heart rate was evaluated by comparing with the heart rate from reference electrocardiogram (ECG) signal. Finally, we developed FaceBEAT, an iPhone application for remote heart rate measurement, based on this study.},

Users contribute data using a web-based electronic lab notebook (Alyx), which automatically registers recorded data files and uploads them to a central server. Users access data with a lightweight interface, the Open Neurophysiology Environment (ONE), which searches data from all labs and loads it into MATLAB or Python. To analyze data, we have developed pipelines based on DataJoint, which automatically populate a website displaying a graphical summary of results to date.

  abstract = {Extreme natural ambient light reduction, in both energy and range of wavelength spectrum, occurs during the winter season at very high latitudes (above the Arctic Circle or 66\textdegree 32{${'}$} North) that in turn results in increased exposure to artificial lighting. In contrast, during the summer months, the sun remains above the horizon and there is no darkness or night. Little is known about these extreme changes in light exposure on human visual perception. Measuring color discriminations with the FM100 Test revealed that Norwegians born above the Arctic Circle were less sensitive to yellow-green, green, and green-blue spectrum differences whereas they were more sensitive to hue variations in the purple range than individuals born below the Arctic Circle. Additionally, it was found that the Norwegian individuals born above the Arctic Circle and during autumn showed an overall decrease in color sensitivity, whereas those born in the summer showed a relative increase. All participants were adults and their color vision was tested in the same location (i.e., in Troms\o{} at 69.7\textdegree{} North). These findings are consistent with the idea that there is a measurable impact on colour vision as adults of the photic environment that individuals born above the Arctic Circle and in the autumn experienced during infancy, namely a reduction in exposure to direct sunlight and an increase in exposure to twilight and artificial lighting.},

While we found LGN functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) responses to these pairs of colors were statistically indistinguishable, primary visual cortex (V1) fMRI responses were stronger to orange\&\#x2013;cyan. Moreover, linear combinations of single-cell responses to cone-isolating stimuli of V1 cone-opponent cells also yielded stronger predicted responses to orange\&\#x2013;cyan over lime\&\#x2013;magenta, suggesting these neurons underlie the fMRI result. These observations are consistent with the hypothesis that V1 recombines LGN signals into \&\#x201C;higher-order\&\#x201D; mechanisms tuned to noncardinal color directions. In light of work showing that natural images and daylight samples are biased toward orange\&\#x2013;cyan, our findings further suggest that V1 is adapted to daylight. V1, especially double-opponent cells, may function to extract spatial information from color boundaries correlated with scene-structure cues, such as shadows lit by ambient blue sky juxtaposed with surfaces reflecting sunshine.},

  abstract = {The existence of color-processing regions in the human ventral visual pathway (VVP) has long been known from patient and imaging studies, but their location in the cortex relative to other regions, their selectivity for color compared with other properties (shape and object category), and their relationship to color-processing regions found in nonhuman primates remain unclear. We addressed these questions by scanning 13 subjects with fMRI while they viewed two versions of movie clips (colored, achromatic) of five different object classes (faces, scenes, bodies, objects, scrambled objects). We identified regions in each subject that were selective for color, faces, places, and object shape, and measured responses within these regions to the 10 conditions in independently acquired data. We report two key findings. First, the three previously reported color-biased regions (located within a band running posterior\textendash anterior along the VVP, present in most of our subjects) were sandwiched between face-selective cortex and place-selective cortex, forming parallel bands of face, color, and place selectivity that tracked the fusiform gyrus/collateral sulcus. Second, the posterior color-biased regions showed little or no selectivity for object shape or for particular stimulus categories and showed no interaction of color preference with stimulus category, suggesting that they code color independently of shape or stimulus category; moreover, the shape-biased lateral occipital region showed no significant color bias. These observations mirror results in macaque inferior temporal cortex (Lafer-Sousa and Conway, 2013), and taken together, these results suggest a homology in which the entire tripartite face/color/place system of primates migrated onto the ventral surface in humans over the course of evolution. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Here we report that color-biased cortex is sandwiched between face-selective and place-selective cortex on the bottom surface of the brain in humans. This face/color/place organization mirrors that seen on the lateral surface of the temporal lobe in macaques, suggesting that the entire tripartite system is homologous between species. This result validates the use of macaques as a model for human vision, making possible more powerful investigations into the connectivity, precise neural codes, and development of this part of the brain. In addition, we find substantial segregation of color from shape selectivity in posterior regions, as observed in macaques, indicating a considerable dissociation of the processing of shape and color in both species.},

To assess the organization of IT, we measured functional magnetic resonance imaging responses in alert monkeys to achromatic images (faces, fruit, bodies and places) and colored gratings. IT contained multiple color-biased regions, which were typically ventral to face patches and yoked to them, spaced regularly at four locations predicted by known anatomy. Color and face selectivity increased for more anterior regions, indicative of a broad hierarchical arrangement. Responses to non-face shapes were found across IT, but were stronger outside color-biased regions and face patches, consistent with multiple parallel streams. IT also contained multiple coarse eccentricity maps: face patches overlapped central representations, color-biased regions spanned mid-peripheral representations and place-biased regions overlapped peripheral representations. These results show that IT comprises parallel, multi-stage processing networks subject to one organizing principle.},

A multistable image must give rise to more than one mutually exclusive percept, typically within single individuals. Clustering algorithms of color-matching data showed that the dress was seen categorically, as white/gold (W/G) or blue/black (B/K), with a blue/brown transition state. Multinomial regression predicted categorical labels. Consistent with our prior hypothesis, W/G observers inferred a cool illuminant, whereas B/K observers inferred a warm illuminant; moreover, subjects could use skin color alone to infer the illuminant. The data provide some, albeit weak, support for our hypothesis that day larks see the dress as W/G and night owls see it as B/K. About half of observers who were previously familiar with the image reported switching categories at least once. Switching probability increased with professional art experience. Priming with an image that disambiguated the dress as B/K biased reports toward B/K (priming with W/G had negligible impact); furthermore, knowledge of the dress's true colors and any prior exposure to the image shifted the population toward B/K. These results show that some people have switched their perception of the dress. Finally, consistent with a role of attention and local image statistics in determining how multistable images are seen, we found that observers tended to discount as achromatic the dress component that they did not attend to: B/K reporters focused on a blue region, whereas W/G reporters focused on a golden region.},

  abstract = {I define a computational model of color perception and color naming which is based in part on neurophysiological data and which can explain results in psychological, anthropological, and linguistic studies on color naming and categorization. In particular, the model explains the graded nature and foci of color categories. This model constitutes a semantic model of basic color terms, grounded in perception. It allows an artificial cognitive agent to name color samples, point out examples of named colors in its environment, and select objects from its environment by color, consistent with human performance on the same tasks. An algorithm and implementation for the computational model is presented, and evaluated theoretically and experimentally. The contributions of this work are in autonomous agent architecture on the one hand, particularly in the area of symbol grounding and embodiment, and in perceptual modeling, particularly color vision, on the other hand. The application presented is a vertically integrated one, ranging from real visual input to symbolic description, and back.},

  abstract = {You can perceive things, in many respects, as they really are. For example, you can correctly see a coin as circular from most angles. Nonetheless, your perception of the world is perspectival. The coin looks different when slanted than when head-on, and there is some respect in which the slanted coin looks similar to a head-on ellipse. Many hold that perception is perspectival because you perceive certain properties that correspond to the ``looks'' of things. I argue that this view is misguided. I consider the two standard versions of this view. What I call the PLURALIST APPROACH fails to give a unified account of the perspectival character of perception, while what I call the PERSPECTIVAL PROPERTIES APPROACH violates central commitments of contemporary psychology. I propose instead that perception is perspectival because of the way perceptual states are structured from their parts.},

  abstract = {While viewing a mondrian in a color constancy task, a subject adapts to the stimulus as well as the other objects in the mondrian. As the adaptation levels due to the mondrian are uncontrolled, the amount of the constancy generated by chromatic adaptation to the stimulus and surround is unknown. The first two experiments measure hue and saturation constancy under natural daylight illuminants in a scaling task due to chromatic adaptation to the illuminant. Both hue and saturation constancy are found to be nearly complete from chromatic adaptation to natural illuminants via a scaling task. A third experiment compares hue constancy generated by chromatic adaptation to the illuminant with the amount of hue constancy generated by a mondrian surround to the stimulus and maintaining a stable state of chromatic adaptation. Chromatic adaptation once again generates very strong constancy while the presence of a mondrian under a controlled adaptation condition seems to do little to promote constancy. These three experiments suggest that chromatic adaptation is an important part of maintaining color constancy and that the most important constancy cue from a mondrian may well be a stimulus to which the visual system can adapt.},

The approaches represented range from neurophysiology to psychophysics, and from retinal function to the analysis of visual cues to motion, color, texture, and depth. The contributions are linked thematically by a consistent consideration of the links between empirical data and computational models in the study of visual function.An introductory chapter by Edward Adelson and James Bergen gives a new and elegant formalization of the elements of early vision. Subsequent sections treat receptors and sampling, models of neural function, detection and discrimination, color and shading, motion and texture, and 3D shape. Each section is introduced by a brief topical review and summary.Michael S. Landy is Associate Professor of Psychology at New York University where J.

  abstract = {Color vision tests can give information about pathological changes in eye structures. The purpose of our research was to study the color vision sensitivity and visual acuity changes before and after cataract surgery. We used a saturated Farnsworth D15 color vision arrangement test to check color sensitivity changes in confusion line directions. The test is easily perceptible (essential to eldery patients), and it is possible to check color sensitivity changes in tritan, protan, and deutan confusion line directions. The results were analyzed in several ways: by summing the color differences between adjacent caps according to Bowman and averaging the color difference vectors according to Vingrys and King\textendash Smith. Color difference vectors determine the severity (or confusion), selectivity (or scatter), and type of color deficiency to the presented cap arrangements. In the least squares regression method, the error type is determined by the angular proximity of the best-fit line to known confusion axes representing protan, deutan, tritan, or unspecified color defects. All three tests showed that cataract-induced lens opacity significantly decreases a patient's chromatic resolution in the visible light region. Before the cataract surgery, the D15 test stimulus arrangement sequence showed similarities with tritan color deficiency.},

  abstract = {A red/green equilibrium light is one which appears neither reddish nor greenish (i.e. either uniquely yellow, uniquely blue, or achromatic). A subset of spectral and nonspectral red/green equilibria was determined for several luminance levels, in order to test whether the set of all such equilibria is closed under linear color-mixture operations. The spectral loci of equilibrium yellow and blue showed either no variation or visually insignificant variation over a range of 1\textendash 2 log10 unit. There were no trends that were repeatable across observers. We concluded that spectral red/green equilibria are closed under scalar multiplication; consequently they are invariant hues relative to the Bezold-Br\"ucke shift. The additive mixture of yellow and blue equilibrium wavelengths, in any luminance ratio, is also an equilibrium light. Small changes of the yellowish component of a mixture toward redness or greeness must be compensated by predictable changes of the bluish component of the mixture toward greenness or redness. We concluded that yellow and blue equilibria are complementary relative to an equilibrium white; that desaturation of a yellow or blue equilibrium light with such a white produces no Abney hue shift; and that the set of red/green equilibria is closed under general linear operations. One consequence is that the red/green chromatic-response function, measured by the Jameson-Hurvich technique of cancellation to equilibrium, is a linear function of the individual's color-matching coordinates. A second consequence of linear closure of equilibria is a strong constraint on the class of combination rules by which receptor outputs are recoded into the red/green opponent process.},

A first step towards efficiency is the elimination of redundancy from the incoming data [2,3,4,5,6] and a second is to code the essential messages in ways that fully exploit neuronal signalling capacity [5]; a procedure that often reduces the redundancy in a nerve cell's response.},

Russians differentiate this region into sinji (``dark blue'') and goluboj (``light blue''); a number of behavioural differences were predicted if these are two basic categories. First, in choosing the most different colour from a triad of colours across the sinij-goluboj boundary, Russians were predicted to ``stretch'' distances between pairs of colours from different lexical categories and to ``shrink'' distances between pairs from the same category. Second, in judging the similarity between pairs of colours, Russians were predicted to maximise perceived similarity between pairs from the same category while minimising perceived similarity of pairs from contrasting categories. Third, asked to sort an array of blue colours into groups, Russians were expected to separate light and dark blues more often than English subjects for whom the colours belong to one lexical category. Little evidence was found for any of the predicted differences in behaviour. In part, this seemed to be due to English subjects also attending to differences between dark and light blues. A final experiment showed that English subjects learn to differentiate the blue region of colour space along a light-dark dimension more readily than the comparable green region.},

Using the method of constant stimuli, two neutrally adapted observers made forced-choice green or red responses to monochromatic test flashes. Results showed a consistent difference between observers (about 5 nm), considerable within-subject variability (standard deviation 3 nm), and significant long-term drifts (\&gt;5 nm) in spectral loci. These results demonstrate the importance of frequently redetermining unique-hue loci when they are used as baselines in chromatic contrast and adaptation studies.},

  abstract = {Light is one of the main factors affecting the visual experience of artworks in museums and can determine the success or failure of an art exhibition. The lighting design is not yet extensively recognized as a crucial element of museum exhibitions, but recent research studies show how different lighting arrangements can create different impressions of the artworks and affect the visual experience of museum visitors. This project involved a psychophysical study of two ancient artworks, a painted panel (14th Century) and a marble sculpture (15th Century), exhibited at the National Museum of San Matteo in Pisa, Italy. Each experiment was set up with different lighting arrangements and different luminaires, with the aim of creating different lighting contrast ratios between the analysed artwork and its background. Those lighting arrangements were presented to different groups of observers in order to investigate the trends of personal preference. The results of the surveys pointed out that, on average, the observers preferred lighting arrangements that provide a certain level of contrast, while configurations with high contrast or almost no contrast were evaluated as less pleasant, less interesting and less suitable to enhance the artworks.},

  abstract = {Atrial fibrillation (AF) affects three to five million Americans and is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Existing methods to diagnose this paroxysmal arrhythmia are cumbersome and/or expensive. We hypothesized that an iPhone 4S can be used to detect AF based on its ability to record a pulsatile photoplethysmogram signal from a fingertip using the built-in camera lens. To investigate the capability of the iPhone 4S for AF detection, we first used two databases, the MIT-BIH AF and normal sinus rhythm (NSR) to derive discriminatory threshold values between two rhythms. Both databases include RR time series originating from 250 Hz sampled ECG recordings. We rescaled the RR time series to 30 Hz so that the RR time series resolution is 1/30 (s) which is equivalent to the resolution from an iPhone 4S. We investigated three statistical methods consisting of the root mean square of successive differences (RMSSD), the Shannon entropy (ShE) and the sample entropy (SampE), which have been proved to be useful tools for AF assessment. Using 64-beat segments from the MIT-BIH databases, we found the beat-to-beat accuracy value of 0.9405, 0.9300, and 0.9614 for RMSSD, ShE, and SampE, respectively. Using an iPhone 4S, we collected 2-min pulsatile time series from 25 prospectively recruited subjects with AF pre- and postelectrical cardioversion. Using derived threshold values of RMSSD, ShE and SampE from the MIT-BIH databases, we found the beat-to-beat accuracy of 0.9844, 0.8494, and 0.9522, respectively. It should be recognized that for clinical applications, the most relevant objective is to detect the presence of AF in the data. Using this criterion, we achieved an accuracy of 100\% for both the MIT-BIH AF and iPhone 4S databases.},

  abstract = {The human visual system encodes the chromatic signals conveyed by the three types of retinal cone photoreceptors in an opponent fashion. This opponency is thought to reduce redundant information by decorrelating the photoreceptor signals. Correlations in the receptor signals are caused by the substantial overlap of the spectral sensitivities of the receptors, but it is not clear to what extent the properties of natural spectra contribute to the correlations. To investigate the influences of natural spectra and photoreceptor spectral sensitivities, we attempted to find linear codes with minimal redundancy for trichromatic images assuming human cone spectral sensitivities, or hypothetical non-overlapping cone sensitivities, respectively. The resulting properties of basis functions are similar in both cases. They are non-orthogonal, show strong opponency along an achromatic direction (luminance edges) and along chromatic directions, and they achieve a highly efficient encoding of natural chromatic signals. Thus, color opponency arises for the encoding of human cone signals, i.e. with strongly overlapping spectral sensitivities, but also under the assumption of non-overlapping spectral sensitivities. Our results suggest that color opponency may in part be a result of the properties of natural spectra and not solely a consequence of the cone spectral sensitivities.},

Twenty observers estimated the overall color difference between the reference and manipulated images shown on an sRGB monitor with 250 cd/m2 as a peak white in a dark room. The magnitude estimation technique was adopted for the visual assessment. The parametric factors of CMC(l:c), and CIEDE2000(l:c) were optimized using the color difference data set. Results showed that CIEDE2000 performs better than CMC. The best ratio for CMC(l:c) is (4:3), while (3.5:1) is the best for CIEDE2000(l:c) for overall color difference prediction.},

  abstract = {Cone or color opponency provides visual neurons with a spectral selectivity more sharply tuned than the absorption spectra of the cone photoreceptors. It is achieved by subtractive interaction of inputs from different cones. In different species, there are different varieties of cone and color opponency, but in human and primates, there are two cone-opponent pathways, one with subtractive input from the middle- and long-wavelength cones and the other with subtractive inputs from the short-wavelength (S) cone and some combination of the other two. These pathways are distinctive anatomically as well as physiologically, and the S-cone pathway is phylogenetically the older. We review these pathways. This way of coding for color is thought to be efficient from an informational standpoint; we argue that these pathways are specialized for transmitting the surface characteristics of objects.},

  abstract = {The surface properties of an object, such as texture, glossiness or colour, provide important cues to its identity. However, the actual visual stimulus received by the eye is determined by both the properties of the object and the illumination. We tested whether operational colour constancy for glossy objects (the ability to distinguish changes in spectral reflectance of the object, from changes in the spectrum of the illumination) was affected by rotational motion of either the object or the light source. The different chromatic and geometric properties of the specular and diffuse reflections provide the basis for this discrimination, and we systematically varied specularity to control the available information. Observers viewed animations of isolated objects undergoing either lighting or surface-based spectral transformations accompanied by motion. By varying the axis of rotation, and surface patterning or geometry, we manipulated: (i) motion-related information about the scene, (ii) relative motion between the surface patterning and the specular reflection of the lighting, and (iii) image disruption caused by this motion. Despite large individual differences in performance with static stimuli, motion manipulations neither improved nor degraded performance. As motion significantly disrupts frame-by-frame low-level image statistics, we infer that operational constancy depends on a high-level scene interpretation, which is maintained in all conditions.},

Full correction would require measuring color and luminance matches and is rarely implemented. However, luminance matches (equiluminance settings) are routinely measured and simple to conduct. We modeled how well an observer's color matches could be approximated by measuring only luminance sensitivity, since both depend on a common set of factors. We show that lens and macular pigment density and \$L/M\$L/M cone ratios alter equiluminance settings in different ways and can therefore be estimated from the settings. In turn, the density variations can account for a large proportion of the normal variation in color matching. Thus, luminance matches may provide a simple method to at least partially predict an observer's color matches without requiring more complex tasks or equipment.},

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$>$}A salient characteristic of monkey inferior temporal (IT) cortex is the IT face processing network. Its hallmarks include: ``face neurons'' that respond more to faces than non-face objects, strong spatial clustering of those neurons in foci at each IT anatomical level (``face patches''), and the preferential interconnection of those foci. While some deep artificial neural networks (ANNs) are good predictors of IT neuronal responses, including face neurons, they do not explain those face network hallmarks. Here we ask if they might be explained with a simple, metabolically motivated addition to current ANN ventral stream models. Specifically, we designed and successfully trained topographic deep ANNs (TDANNs) to solve real-world visual recognition tasks (as in prior work), but, in addition, we also optimized each network to minimize a proxy for neuronal wiring length within its IT layers. We report that after this dual optimization, the model IT layers of TDANNs reproduce the hallmarks of the IT face network: the presence of face neurons, clusters of face neurons that quantitatively match those found in IT face patches, connectivity between those patches, and the emergence of face viewpoint invariance along the network hierarchy. We find that these phenomena emerge for a range of naturalistic experience, but not for highly unnatural training. Taken together, these results show that the IT face processing network could be a consequence of a basic hierarchical anatomy along the ventral stream, selection pressure on the visual system to accomplish general object categorization, and selection pressure to minimize axonal wiring length.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

We used a paradigm in which subjects searched for a randomly selected target from one category (e.g., one of 32 line drawings of artifacts or animals in displays ranging from three to nine items) among a mixed set of distractors from the other. We found that search was surprisingly fast. Target-present slopes for animal targets among artifacts ranged from 10.8 to 16.0 msec/item, and slopes for artifact targets ranged from 5.5 to 6.2 msec/item. Experiments 2\textendash 5 tested factors that affect both the speed of the search and the search asymmetry favoring detection of artifacts among animals. They converge on the conclusion that target-distractor differences in global contour shape (e.g., rectilinearity/curvilinearity) and visual typicality of parts and form facilitate search by category. We argue that existing theories are helpful in understanding these findings but that they need to be supplemented to account for the specific features that specify categories and to account for subjects' ability to quickly locate targets representing heterogeneous and formally complex categories.},

It has been theorized that there may be a large amount of overlap between the neural representations of these objects and processing involved in color perception. In accordance with this theory we sought to determine if the recognition of highly color diagnostic fruit objects could be facilitated by the visual presentation of their known color associates. In two experiments we show that color associate priming is possible, but contingent upon multiple factors. Color priming was found to be maximally effective for the most highly color diagnostic fruits, when low spatial-frequency information was present in the image, and when determination of the object's specific identity, not merely its category, was required. These data illustrate the importance of color for determining the identity of certain objects, and support the theory that object knowledge involves sensory specific systems.},

In practice, however, one-step chromatic adaptation models, that avoid the use of the intermediate CIE illuminant E, are also employed. Tests using the one-step CAT16 model indicate failures of both the symmetry and transitivity properties, except in the case where the degree of adaptation D is equal to unity. The magnitude of these failures depends on the specific illuminants selected, and increases as the degree of adaptation decreases. From four possible two-step CAT16 models, we have identified two that obey the symmetry and transitivity properties, one with slightly better predictions of the experimental corresponding-color datasets available in the literature, and more consistent with the one-step CAT16 model. The findings of this article confirm that, for incomplete adaptation, the use of the one-step CAT is incorrect, and we propose that the use of a two-step CAT16 model be mandatory for future applications.},

If we are given a new set of color matching functions, how do we define a CIELAB-like uniform color space for the new functions? This problem arises because the CIE recommended its physiological cone fundamentals in 2006 and is considering a new set of color matching functions based on them. In fact, the same problem exists for many practical applications in digital imaging. Typical solutions involve using illuminant-dependent color correction matrices to transform the device-dependent color space into the CIE XYZ color space. This conversion process suffers information loss unless the two sets of color matching functions are linear combinations of each other. In this paper, we propose a design process that allows us to develop a CIELAB-like color space using the native sensor fundamentals. The basic idea is to choose the daylight locus as the yellow\&\#x2013;blue opponent color process. We call this class of color space DLAB. We describe the design procedures and compare the resulting Munsell color uniformity under CIELAB (L*,a*,b*) and DLAB (L+,a+,b+).},

Through pairwise interactions in the games, agents acquire a set of vocabulary in their memory for object naming. The existing model confines to a one-to-one mapping between a name and an object. Focus is usually put onto name consensus in the population rather than knowledge learning in agents, and hence simple learning model is usually adopted. However, the cognition system of human being is much more complex and knowledge is usually presented in a complicated form. Therefore, in this work, we extend the agent learning model and design a new game to incorporate domain learning, which is essential for more complicated form of knowledge. In particular, we demonstrate the evolution of color categorization and naming in a population of agents. We incorporate the human perceptive model into the agents and introduce two new concepts, namely subjective perception and subliminal stimulation, in domain learning. Simulation results show that, even without any supervision or pre-requisition, a consensus of a color naming system can be reached in a population solely via the interactions. Our work confirms the importance of society interactions in color categorization, which is a long debate topic in human cognition. Moreover, our work also demonstrates the possibility of cognitive system development in autonomous intelligent agents.},

Although many comprehensive evaluations or reviews about color constancy methods are available, few focus on combinational strategies.

A number of methods of combining illumination estimates obtained from multiple subordinate illumination estimation methods now appear in the literature. These combinational methods aim to provide better illumination estimates by fusing the information embedded in the subordinate solutions. The existing combinational methods are surveyed and analyzed here with the goals of determining: 1) the effectiveness of fusing illumination estimates from multiple subordinate methods; 2) the best method of combination; 3) the underlying factors that affect the performance of a combinational method; and 4) the effectiveness of combination for illumination estimation in multiple-illuminant scenes. The various combinational methods are categorized in terms of whether or not they require supervised training and whether or not they rely on high-level scene content cues (e.g., indoor versus outdoor). Extensive tests and enhanced analyzes using three data sets of real-world images are conducted. For consistency in testing, the images were labeled according to their high-level features (3D stages, indoor/outdoor) and this label data is made available on-line. The tests reveal that the trained combinational methods (direct combination by support vector regression in particular) clearly outperform both the non-combinational methods and those combinational methods based on scene content cues.},

The measurements and modeling of the canopy reflectance can help gain a better understanding and lead to a better interpretation of remotely sensed data. Studies were conducted on subjects related to canopy reflectance, including leaf orientation, canopy bidirectional reflectance and modeling, and the assessment on the background contribution to the canopy reflectance. Direct measurements of the leaf angle distributions of 14 types of plant canopies were taken using a Spatial Coordinate Apparatus. Four categories of zenith angle distributions were found. These were planophile, plagiophile, erectophile, and uniform. Some canopies were found to have non-uniform leaf azimuth angle distributions and there were differences between the upper and lower parts of the canopies for some species. Field measurements were conducted to examine the reflectance characteristics of selected vegetation canopies as affected by the view and solar angles. Strong relationships were observed between the reflectance factor and the view and solar angles for each canopy although differences were found among canopies. A canopy reflectance model based on radiative transport was examined to assess the effects of the major model input parameters on the canopy reflectance. Comparisons were made between measured and the model generated canopy reflectance. The model indicated that the leaf normal distribution can have large affect on the canopy reflectance in the near-infrared spectral region, as well as the red spectral region when leaf area index is small. Large differences in reflectance were observed by using different leaf scattering functions. The bi-Lambertian leaf scattering model showed the best agreement with the measured soybean canopy reflectance data. The second derivatives of canopy reflectance were examined and used a spectral indices to eliminate soil background contribution to measured reflectance. Two "windows" of second derivatives, \$\textbackslash rm \textbackslash rho\textbackslash sp\{\textbackslash prime\textbackslash prime\}\textbackslash sb\{0.69\textbackslash mu m\}\$ and \$\textbackslash rm \textbackslash rho\textbackslash sp\{\textbackslash prime\textbackslash prime\}\textbackslash sb\{0.74\textbackslash mu m\}\$, exist which can be used to estimate plant growth parameters such as LAI. The second derivatives showed an advantage over the commonly used near-infrared:red ratio for eliminating the soil background contributions to the composite of soil/canopy spectrum.},

This system shows a high correlation to other peel colour analysis methods (spectral analysis, tristimulus colorimeter analysis, and visual colour matching). Regression equations were developed to predict the chlorophyll content of banana peels, which is primarily responsible for the change in the colour of the peel. This optical chlorophyll sensing system has the following characteristics: rapid response, simple operation, non-destructive measurement, and low cost. The potential application of this system in automatic monitoring of banana ripening is also discussed.},

  abstract = {Colors distinguishable with trichromatic vision can be defined by a 3D color space, such as red-green-blue or hue-saturation-lightness (HSL) space, but it remains unclear how the cortex represents colors along these dimensions. Using intrinsic optical imaging and electrophysiology, and systematically choosing color stimuli from HSL coordinates, we examined how perceptual colors are mapped in visual area V4 in behaving macaques. We show that any color activates 1-4 separate cortical patches within "globs," millimeter-sized color-preferring modules. Most patches belong to different hue or lightness clusters, in which sequential representations follow the color order in HSL space. Some patches overlap greatly with those of related colors, forming stacks, possibly representing invariable features, whereas few seem positioned irregularly. However, for any color, saturation increases the activity of all its patches. These results reveal how the color map in V4 is organized along the framework of the perceptual HSL space, whereupon different multipatch activity patterns represent different colors. We propose that such distributed and combinatorial representations may expand the encodable color space of small cortical maps and facilitate binding color information to other image features.},

We performed simultaneous recordings of local field potentials (LFPs) and single unit activity (SUA) in areas V4 and lateral prefrontal cortex to characterize their contribution to visual processing. Here, we trained monkeys to identify natural images at different degradation levels in a visual recognition task. We parametrically varied color and structural information of natural images while the animals were performing the task. We show that the visual-evoked potential (VEP) of the LFP in V4 is highly sensitive to color, whereas the VEP in prefrontal cortex predominantly depends on image structure. When examining the relationship between VEP and SUA, we found that stimulus sensitivity for SUA was well predicted by the VEP in PF cortex but not in V4. Our results first reveal a functional specialization in both areas at the level of the LFP and further suggest that the degree to which mesoscopic signals, such as the VEP, are representative of the underlying SUA neural processing may be brain region specific within the context of visual recognition.},

This paper presents a psychophysical experiment in which 70 observers evaluated the colour quality of natural objects under different spectral power distributions with different values of FCI but the same correlated colour temperature (3000 and 5000 K). Results show that FCI holds a nearly perfect linear correlation with vividness (r = 0.976); unnaturalness associated with enhanced vividness rendered by excessively high FCI deteriorates preference. These effects are independent of correlated colour temperatures, but are dependent upon the visual targets used because of limitations in the derivation of FCI. Compared to other metrics, FCI can characterise vividness under a light source.},

Taking into account the natural spectral width of each of the LED wavelengths, a reasonably well-behaved and spike-free spectral continuum is demonstrated. The LED light source is based on a modular design that facilitates fabrication of arbitrarily large area simulators for both single solar cell and multi-cell module test and evaluation. The spectral tunability of this simulator makes it an attractive instrument for use in evaluating the performance of both conventional solar cells and tandem solar cells. The basic modular building block is a 10 cm x 10 cm ``tile'' consisting of the LED emitter platform with reflecting side mirrors and driver electronics conveniently located directly underneath the emitter platform in a compact yet flexible configuration. Combinations of tiles facilitate manufacture of solar simulators of arbitrarily large size and shape, with the advantages of high reliability, spectral tunability, lighter weight, no water cooling requirements and absence of high voltages. Excellent spectral mixing and intensity uniformity is obtained on the measurement plane, resulting in a simulator that meets Class AAA specifications according to ASTM and IEC standards.},

Despite the fact that these tools shape the progress of the field as a whole, we have little empirical proof that they are effective at identifying the mechanisms of interest. At the same time, deep learning systems are trained to produce intelligent behavior using neural networks, and the resulting models are impressive but also largely impenetrable. Can the tools of neuroscience be applied to artificial neural networks (ANNs) and if so what would this process tell us about ANNs, brains, and \textendash{} most importantly \textendash{} the tools themselves? Here we argue that applying analysis methods from neuroscience to ANNs will provide a much-needed test of the abilities of these tools. It would also encourage the development of a unified field of neural systems understanding, which can identify shared concepts and methods for studying distributed information processing in artificial and biological systems. To support this argument, we review methods commonly used in neuroscience, along with work that has demonstrated how these methods can be applied to ANNs and what we learn from this, and related efforts from interpretable AI.},

A free-naming task produced 122 monolexemic color terms, with which informants named the 330 Munsell samples from the World Color Survey. Cluster analysis consolidated those terms into a glossary of 20 named color categories: the 11 Basic Color Term (BCT) categories of Berlin and Kay (1969, p. 2) plus nine nonbasic chromatic categories. The glossed data revealed two color-naming motifs: the green\textendash blue motif of the World Color Survey and a novel green\textendash teal\textendash blue motif, which featured peach, teal, lavender, and maroon as high-consensus terms. Women used more terms than men, and more women expressed the novel motif. Under a constrained-naming protocol, informants supplied BCTs for the color samples previously given nonbasic terms. Most of the glossed nonbasic terms from the free-naming task named low-consensus colors located at the BCT boundaries revealed by the constrained-naming task. This study provides evidence for continuing evolution of the color lexicon of American English, and provides insight into the processes governing this evolution.},

  abstract = {In multidimensional models, simultaneous confidence or credibility regions for continuous parameters hold the overall frequentist long run or Bayesian posterior probability constant at some level such as 95\%. This means that, as the dimensionality of the problem increases, the precision or information required about each individual parameter also rapidly increases so parameters have progressively less chance of being set to 0 in such a model selection procedure. These methods do not appropriately answer most of the inference questions that are generally encountered in applied statistics. Thus, sample size, model selection criteria and the estimation of parameter precision are intimately related. In contrast with frequentist and Bayesian procedures, direct likelihood inference, calibrating acceptable likelihood regions by criteria derived from model selection, such as the Akaike information criterion, holds the precision requirements per parameter constant as the dimensionality grows, thus allowing the series of inferences to remain compatible. Other model selection criteria, such as the Bayes information criterion, that depend on the sample size, maintain compatibility but decrease the precision per parameter as the sample increases, so, in the limit, the null model tends to be chosen (Lindley's paradox).}

Analysis of concordance in color naming within WCS languages revealed small regions in color space that exhibited statistically significantly high concordance across languages. These regions agreed well with five of six primary focal colors of English. Concordance analysis also revealed boundary regions of statistically significantly low concordance. These boundary regions coincided with the boundaries associated with English WARM and COOL. Our results provide compelling evidence for similarities in the mechanisms that guide the lexical partitioning of color space among WCS languages and English.},

  abstract = {The color rendition engine based on the statistical metric allows us to uniquely quantify the characteristics of color quality of illumination and assess the color rendition preferences. We now report on using the color rendition engine for revealing individual and cultural differences in color quality preferences of 205 American and Chinese subjects. Our study demonstrated that the majority of individuals preferred the color blend with the same statistical figures of merit on the average but with a much larger spread of blends for Americans. For both groups, the color rendition preferences depended on the object being illuminated. This was demonstrated by illuminating a set of common colored objects and three different paintings. We conclude that the color quality of lighting can be optimized and enhanced using the feedback to change the spectral power distribution of the illuminating source depending on the object being illuminated and on the preferences of an individual observer and a cultural group.},

  abstract = {In general, computational methods to estimate the color of the light source are based on single, low-level image cues such as pixel values and edges. Only a few methods are proposed exploiting multiple cues for color constancy by incorporating pixel values, edge information and higher-order image statistics. However, expanding color constancy beyond these low-level image statistics (pixels, edges and n-jets) to include high-level cues and integrate all these cues together into a unified framework has not been explored. In this paper, the color of the light source is estimated using (low-level) image statistics, (intermediate-level) regions, and (high-level) scene characteristics. A Bayesian framework is proposed combining the different cues in a principled way. Our experiments show that the proposed algorithm outperforms the original Bayesian method. The mean error is reduced by 33.3\% with respect to the original Bayesian method and the median error is reduced by 37.1\% on the re-processed version of the Gehler color constancy dataset. Our method outperforms most of the state-of-the-art color constancy algorithms in mean angular error and obtains the highest accuracy in terms of median angular error.},

  abstract = {Background: Citation counts for peer-reviewed articles and the impact factor of journals have long been indicators of article importance or quality. In the Web 2.0 era, growing numbers of scholars are using scholarly social network tools to communicate scientific ideas with colleagues, thereby making traditional indicators less sufficient, immediate, and comprehensive. In these new situations, the altmetric indicators offer alternative measures that reflect the multidimensional nature of scholarly impact in an immediate, open, and individualized way. In this direction of research, some studies have demonstrated the correlation between altmetrics and traditional metrics with different samples. However, up to now, there has been relatively little research done on the dimension and interaction structure of altmetrics. Objective: Our goal was to reveal the number of dimensions that altmetric indicators should be divided into and the structure in which altmetric indicators interact with each other. Methods: Because an article-level metrics dataset is collected from scholarly social media and open access platforms, it is one of the most robust samples available to study altmetric indicators. Therefore, we downloaded a large dataset containing activity data in 20 types of metrics present in 33,128 academic articles from the application programming interface website. First, we analyzed the correlation among altmetric indicators using Spearman rank correlation. Second, we visualized the multiple correlation coefficient matrixes with graduated colors. Third, inputting the correlation matrix, we drew an MDS diagram to demonstrate the dimension for altmetric indicators. For correlation structure, we used a social network map to represent the social relationships and the strength of relations. Results: We found that the distribution of altmetric indicators is significantly non-normal and positively skewed. The distribution of downloads and page views follows the Pareto law. Moreover, we found that the Spearman coefficients from 91.58\% of the pairs of variables indicate statistical significance at the .01 level. The non-metric MDS map divided the 20 altmetric indicators into three clusters: traditional metrics, active altmetrics, and inactive altmetrics. The social network diagram showed two subgroups that are tied to each other but not to other groups, thus indicating an intersection between altmetrics and traditional metric indicators. Conclusions: Altmetrics complement, and most correlate significantly with, traditional measures. Therefore, in future evaluations of the social impact of articles, we should consider not only traditional metrics but also active altmetrics. There may also be a transfer phenomenon for the social impact of academic articles. The impact transfer path has transfer, or intermediate, stations that transport and accelerate article social impact from active altmetrics to traditional metrics and vice versa. This discovery will be helpful to explain the impact transfer mechanism of articles in the Web 2.0 era. Hence, altmetrics are in fact superior to traditional filters for assessing scholarly impact in multiple dimensions and in terms of social structure.  [J Med Internet Res 2013;15(11):e259]},

The purpose of this paper is to evaluate the performance of PPGi waveform acquisition in the red, green, and blue channels using a commercial camera in different light conditions. The system, developed for this paper, comprises of a commercial camera and light sources with varied spectra and intensities. Signals were acquired from the fingertips of 12 healthy subjects. Extensive experiments, using different wavelength lights and white light with variation light intensities, respectively, reported in this paper, showed that almost all light spectra can acquire acceptable pulse rates, but only 470-, 490-, 505-, 590-, 600-, 610-, 625-, and 660-nm wavelength lights showed better performance in PPGi waveform compared with gold standard. With lower light intensity, the light spectra {$>$}600 nm still showed better performance. The change in pulse amplitude (ac) and dc amplitude was also investigated with the different light intensity and light spectra. With increasing light intensity, the dc amplitude increased, whereas ac component showed an initial increase followed by a decrease. Most of the subjects achieved their maximum averaging ac output when averaging dc output was in the range from 180 to 220 pixel values (8 b, 255 maximum pixel value). The results suggested that an adaptive solution could be developed to optimize the design of PPGi-based physiological signal acquisition devices in different light conditions.},

We find a progressive evolution in the scale and precision of chromotopic maps, expressed by a uniform blob-like architecture of hue responses within each area. Two-photon imaging reveals enhanced hue-specific cell clustering in V2 compared with V1. A phenomenon of endspectral (red and blue) responses that is clear in V1, recedes in V2, and is virtually absent in V4. The increase in mid- and extra-spectral hue representations through V2 and V4 reflects the nature of hierarchical processing as higher areas read out locations in chromatic space from progressive integration of signals relayed by V1.},

  abstract = {Ganglion cells (GCs) are fundamental to retinal neural circuitry, processing photoreceptor signals for transmission to the brain via their axons. However, much remains unknown about their role in vision and their vulnerability to disease leading to blindness. A major bottleneck has been our inability to observe GCs and their degeneration in the living human eye. Despite two decades of development of optical technologies to image cells in the living human retina, GCs remain elusive due to their high optical translucency. Failure of conventional imaging\textemdash using predominately singly scattered light\textemdash to reveal GCs has led to a focus on multiply-scattered, fluorescence, two-photon, and phase imaging techniques to enhance GC contrast. Here, we show that singly scattered light actually carries substantial information that reveals GC somas, axons, and other retinal neurons and permits their quantitative analysis. We perform morphometry on GC layer somas, including projection of GCs onto photoreceptors and identification of the primary GC subtypes, even beneath nerve fibers. We obtained singly scattered images by: (i) marrying adaptive optics to optical coherence tomography to avoid optical blurring of the eye; (ii) performing 3D subcellular image registration to avoid motion blur; and (iii) using organelle motility inside somas as an intrinsic contrast agent. Moreover, through-focus imaging offers the potential to spatially map individual GCs to underlying amacrine, bipolar, horizontal, photoreceptor, and retinal pigment epithelium cells, thus exposing the anatomical substrate for neural processing of visual information. This imaging modality is also a tool for improving clinical diagnosis and assessing treatment of retinal disease.},

The aim of this study was to explore how different CS and CCT make an influence to human beings in different time period. Fifteen participants (9 males and 6 females) were recruited. The seven lighting conditions were 3L (CCT=3000K, CS=0.22), 3H (CCT=3000K, CS=0.42), 4L (CCT=3000K, CS=0.28), 4M (CCT=3000K, CS=0.35), 4H (CCT=3000K, CS=0.39), 5L (CCT=3000K, CS=0.40), 5H (CCT=3000K, CS=0.45). Only cortisol levels results showed main effects of time period. The results showed that exposure to high CS is associated with higher cortisol levels, higher speed in D2 test and Eriksen flanker test, higher accuracy, more alert in EEG and better color discrimination. Based on the data we developed a polynomial model to predict the alertness or work performance according to CCT and CS (mean RMSE=0.17 and mean R=0.63). This model also fit our previous experiment dataset (mean RMSE= 0.26 and mean R=0.63).},

  abstract = {This paper proposes a method to recover the pulse signal with the theory of lock-in amplifier and calculates the oxygen saturation. The pulse signal is obtained based on the method of Photoplethysmography (PPG). We use a LED as the light source and a photoelectric diode as the receiver to get a measured pulse wave. Because the pulse wave obtained by this method is easily disturbed by motion artifact, we use an electrocardiogram (ECG) signal to aid PPG measurement. Firstly, the ECG signal is processed by the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) and get the heart rate. Secondly, with the value of heart rate, a typical noise free pulse waveform can be constructed. Finally, we use it as a reference input to get a recovered pulse wave by the theory of lock-in amplifier. Thus, the value of oxygen saturation can be calculated accurately through two recovered pulse waveforms of red (660nm) and infrared (940nm) light. Some volunteers were tested. The correlation coefficient between the experimental data and the data provided by a reference instrument is 0.98, proving that this method has high reliability and utility in motion.},

  abstract = {Spectrally tunable light sources for general lighting have recently attracted much attention as versatile solutions that can be used in humancentric lighting implementations provided with excellent color rendering and increased user perception. However, temperature and age-dependent color shifts and flux variations in the light-emitting diode (LED) emission are nonresolved challenges that need to be overcome in order to be used in final applications. We demonstrate two strategies that can be used to efficiently and precisely generate arbitrary spectral power distributions (SPDs) using multichannel LED engines. First, we introduce different methods to match a given SPD and select an algorithm (simulated annealing) in virtue of its speed (in the milliseconds range) and accuracy (color shifts {$\Delta$}u {${'}$} v {${'}$} {$<$} 5 \texttimes{} 10 - 4). Then, we propose a closed-loop feedback control (PID) to compensate for spectral shifts due to temperature changes or lumen decay of the LEDs. Both methods can be used independently, but only a combination of them (which uses the output of the first method as an initial guess for the second) offers fast computational times and high spectral accuracy and precision. Computation times are important because these algorithms are intended to be executed on dedicated microprocessors integrated in the LED modules, often sharing scarce memory and processing resources. The results presented here are aimed to be universal and hold for different implementations of the light engine and any number of LED channels.},

This feature allows LMMs to address some of the problems identified by Speelman and McGann (2013) about the use of mean data, because they do not average across individual responses. However, recent guidelines for using LMM to analyse skewed reaction time (RT) data collected in many cognitive psychological studies recommend the application of non-linear transformations to satisfy assumptions of normality. Uncritical adoption of this recommendation has important theoretical implications which can yield misleading conclusions. For example, Balota, Aschenbrenner and Yap (2013) showed that analyses of raw RT produced additive effects of word frequency and stimulus quality on word identification, which conflicted with the interactive effects observed in analyses of transformed RT. Generalized linear mixed-effect models (GLMM) provide a solution to this problem by satisfying normality assumptions without the need for transformation. This allows differences between individuals to be properly assessed, using the metric most appropriate to the researcher's theoretical context. We outline the major theoretical decisions involved in specifying a GLMM, and illustrate them by reanalysing Balota et al.'s datasets. We then consider the broader benefits of using GLMM to investigate individual differences.},

Mankind has evolved over many, many, thousands of years under daylight; that is light directly from the sun and by reflection. Daylight has a broad, relatively smooth spectral distribution embracing the full colour range of the human visual system. Electric illumination has been available for barely 100 years and has developed considerably from the humble incandescent light bulb through discharge sources and now solid state light emitting devices but its measurement systems are based on a much narrower spectral distribution, agreed internationally in 1924, the CIE V{$\lambda$} distribution. Systems of colour measurement came much later, but are considered insufficiently accurately for modern light sources. Possible alternatives are considered. It also explores the human response to light and colour with respect to environment design.},

Following a long career in illumination research and observation I have concluded that to base so much on foveal response must be wrong. The paper makes a summary review of past research leading to the conclusion that there is a need to take account of the response of the whole retina in terms of conscious and sub-conscious sight affecting possible physiological processes. With the rapid development of the light emitting diode the need for a more comprehensive approach to illumination measurement and design is particularly important. The work concludes with some suggested research to carry the work forward.},

The project explores by experiment in a full-scale mock-up gallery the lighting requirements in terms of three variables: painting illuminance, light source and light distribution within the gallery space. Subjective assessments were made using semantic differential scales and the results were analysed using factor analysis techniques. The findings indicate that a painting illuminance approaching 200 lux was required to give visual satisfaction from an illuminant with a high Colour Rendering Index and a high gamut area: also a degree of non-uniformity in light distribution was preferred. The work recommends that where strict conservation requirements are to be employed, then artificial lighting only should be used but that the galleries should be combined with other spaces lit with natural light, perhaps for the display of non-light-sensitive exhibits.},

  abstract = {The visual cortex contains multiple retinotopic representations of the visual field. A long-standing question of visual neuroscience concerns the role of these different regions in visual computations and perception. Differences in psychophysical properties have also been noted across the visual field, varying with eccentricity and with the upper and lower hemifields. Inspired by studies that used linear-systems-defined stimuli to characterize single neuron responses, we collected fMRI data from two macaque monkeys as they passively viewed gratings that varied in color, saturation, and spatial frequency. We apply a novel variant of multivariate linear discriminant analysis to discover combinations of these features that best separated visual cortex, along three dimensions of representation: eccentricity; classic retinotopic progression (V1, V2, V3, V3a, V4, MT+); and upper vs lower visual field. As expected from prior work, eccentricity across all visual areas was characterized by responses to color and spatial frequency: foveal regions, compared to peripheral regions, showed greater responses to colors not restricted to the S-cone-axis and high spatial frequency. Retinotopic visual areas were characterized by their responses to saturation: relative to anterior visual areas (V3-V4, V3a, MT+), posterior areas (V1-V2) were more responsive to increases in saturation. And upper-vs-lower representations were distinguished by responses to colors modulating along the Daylight locus: ventral areas showed relatively higher responses to colors associated with the Daylight locus (orange/blue) as compared to responses to achromatic luminance. Together, these results provide a data driven approach that recovers functional signatures of retinotopic organization using color and spatial frequency, providing clues toward the different roles that the components of retinotopic cortex play in visual perception.},

Metamer mismatching refers to the fact that two objects reflecting metameric light under one illumination may reflect non-metameric light under a second; so two objects appearing as having the same colour under one illuminant can appear as having different colours under a second. Yet since Helmholtz, object colour has generally been believed to remain relatively constant. The deviations from colour constancy registered in experiments are usually thought to be small enough that they do not contradict the notion of colour constancy. However, it is important to determine how the deviations from colour constancy relate to the limits metamer mismatching imposes on constancy. Hence, we calculated metamer mismatching's effect for the 20 Munsell papers and 8 pairs of illuminants employed in the colour constancy study by Logvinenko and Tokunaga and found it to be so extensive that the two notions\textemdash metamer mismatching and colour constancy\textemdash must be mutually exclusive. In particular, the notion of colour constancy leads to some paradoxical phenomena such as the possibility of 20 objects having the same colour under chromatic light dispersing into a hue circle of colours under neutral light. Thus, colour constancy refers to a phenomenon, which because of metamer mismatching, simply cannot exist. Moreover, it obscures the really important visual phenomenon; namely, the alteration of object colours induced by illumination change. We show that colour is not an independent, intrinsic attribute of an object, but rather an attribute of an object/light pair, and then define a concept of material colour in terms of equivalence classes of such object/light pairs. We suggest that studying the shift in material colour under a change in illuminant will be more fruitful than pursuing colour constancy's false premise that colour is an intrinsic attribute of an object.},

Here we test the hypothesis that these basic color attributes are determined by the statistical covariations in the spectral stimuli that humans have always experienced in typical visual environments. Using a database of 1,600 natural images, we analyzed the joint probability distributions of the physical variables most relevant to each of these perceptual qualities. The cumulative density functions derived from these distributions predict the major colorimetric functions that have been reported in psychophysical experiments over the last century.},

  abstract = {Artificial lighting allows humans to be active at night, but has many unintended consequences, including interference with ecological processes, disruption of circadian rhythms and increased exposure to insect vectors of diseases. Although ultraviolet and blue light are usually most attractive to arthropods, degree of attraction varies among orders. With a focus on future indoor lighting applications, we manipulated the spectrum of white lamps to investigate the influence of spectral composition on number of arthropods attracted. We compared numbers of arthropods captured at three customizable light-emitting diode (LED) lamps (3510, 2704 and 2728 K), two commercial LED lamps (2700 K), two commercial compact fluorescent lamps (CFLs; 2700 K) and a control. We configured the three custom LEDs to minimize invertebrate attraction based on published attraction curves for honeybees and moths. Lamps were placed with pan traps at an urban and two rural study sites in Los Angeles, California. For all invertebrate orders combined, our custom LED configurations were less attractive than the commercial LED lamps or CFLs of similar colour temperatures. Thus, adjusting spectral composition of white light to minimize attracting nocturnal arthropods is feasible; not all lights with the same colour temperature are equally attractive to arthropods.},

These intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells (ipRGCs) have well-established roles in a variety of reflex responses to changes in ambient light intensity, including circadian photoentrainment. In this article, we review the growing evidence, obtained primarily from laboratory mice and humans, that the ability to sense light via melanopsin is also an important component of perceptual and form vision. Melanopsin photoreception has low temporal resolution, making it fundamentally biased toward detecting changes in ambient light and coarse patterns rather than fine details. Nevertheless, melanopsin can indirectly impact high-acuity vision by driving aspects of light adaptation ranging from pupil constriction to changes in visual circuit performance. Melanopsin also contributes directly to perceptions of brightness, and recent data suggest that this influences the appearance not only of overall scene brightness, but also of low-frequency patterns.

  abstract = {In mammals, a small number of retinal ganglion cells express melanopsin, an opsin photopigment, allowing them to be directly photoreceptive. A major function of these so-called intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells (ipRGCs) is to synchronize (entrain) endogenous circadian clocks to the external light:dark cycle. Thanks to their intrinsic light response, ipRGCs can support photoentrainment even when the other retinal photoreceptors (rods and cones) are absent or inactive. However, in the intact retina the ipRGC light response is a composite of extrinsic (rod/cone) and intrinsic (melanopsin) influences. As a result all three photoreceptor classes contribute to the retinal pathways providing light information to the clock. Here, we consider what each photoreceptor type contributes to the clock light response. We review electrophysiological and behavioral data pertinent to this question, primarily from laboratory rodents, drawing them together to provide a conceptual model in which each photoreceptor class plays a distinct role in encoding the light environment. We finally use this model to highlight some of the important outstanding questions in this field.},

An action spectrum for the PLR in rd/rd cl mice demonstrates that over the range 420-625 nm, this response is driven by a single opsin/vitamin A-based photopigment with peak sensitivity around 479 nm (opsin photopigment/OP479).

We summarize the neurophysiology of this newly described sensory pathway and consider implications for the measurement, production, and application of light. A new light-measurement strategy taking account of the complex photoreceptive inputs to these non-visual responses is proposed for use by researchers, and simple suggestions for artificial/architectural lighting are provided for regulatory authorities, lighting manufacturers, designers, and engineers.},

  abstract = {Color constancy was studied under conditions simulating either natural or extremely artificial illumination. Four test illuminants were used: two broadband phases of daylight (correlated color temperatures 4000 and 25,000 K) and two spectrally impoverished metamers of these lights, each consisting of only two wavelengths. A computer controlled color monitor was used for reproducing the chromaticities and luminances of an array of Munsell color samples rendered under these illuminants. An asymmetric haploscopic matching paradigm was used in which the same stimulus pattern, either illuminated by one of the test illuminants, or by a standard broadband daylight (D65), was alternately presented to the left and right eye. Subjects adjusted the RGB settings of the samples seen under D65 (match condition), to match the appearance of the color samples seen under the test illuminant. The results show the expected failure of color constancy under two-wavelengths illumination, and approximate color constancy under natural illumination. Quantitative predictions of the results were made on the basis of two different models, a computational model for recovering surface reflectance, and a model that assumes the color response to be determined by cone-specific contrast and absolute level of stimulation (Lucassen and Walraven, 1993). The latter model was found to provide somewhat more accurate predictions, under all illuminant conditions. Copyright \textcopyright{} 1996 Elsevier Science Ltd.},

  abstract = {We measure the color fidelity of visual scenes that are rendered under different (simulated) illuminants and shown on a calibrated LCD display. Observers make triad illuminant comparisons involving the renderings from two chromatic test illuminants and one achromatic reference illuminant shown simultaneously. Four chromatic test illuminants are used: two along the daylight locus (yellow and blue), and two perpendicular to it (red and green). The observers select the rendering having the best color fidelity, thereby indirectly judging which of the two test illuminants induces the smallest color differences compared to the reference. Both multicolor test scenes and natural scenes are studied. The multicolor scenes are synthesized and represent ellipsoidal distributions in CIELAB chromaticity space having the same mean chromaticity but different chromatic orientations. We show that, for those distributions, color fidelity is best when the vector of the illuminant change (pointing from neutral to chromatic) is parallel to the major axis of the scene\&\#x2019;s chromatic distribution. For our selection of natural scenes, which generally have much broader chromatic distributions, we measure a higher color fidelity for the yellow and blue illuminants than for red and green. Scrambled versions of the natural images are also studied to exclude possible semantic effects. We quantitatively predict the average observer response (i.e., the illuminant probability) with four types of models, differing in the extent to which they incorporate information processing by the visual system. Results show different levels of performance for the models, and different levels for the multicolor scenes and the natural scenes. Overall, models based on the scene averaged color difference have the best performance. We discuss how color constancy algorithms may be improved by exploiting knowledge of the chromatic distribution of the visual scene.},

Starting from previous works [1] the color (hue, saturation) features have been identified as important factors for quality assessment of color images. Therefore, we present an approach based on color features that takes into account the spatial relationship between coloured regions. This metric works on the whole image by using an algorithm of regions extraction and another exploiting adjacent matrix. Different algorithms of regions extraction are implemented (classification and segmentation) to raise the importance of this step inside the no-reference metric and to know where this regions extraction is needed, either in the input image or in the perceveid (output) image. Finally, the metric correlates in a significant manner with the subjective results.},

To improve visual perception, a light source with optimal spectral distribution has been calculated. This spectral distribution minimizes the damage, maximizes the colorimetric distance between the color of the rock paintings and the closer stone, and takes into account how it was lit by the author. A mathematical function has been used to optimize the spectral distribution of the light source. With this aim, a tunable red\textendash green\textendash blue (RGB) light emitting diode (LED) luminaire has been used. It has been found that the new calculated lighting of the cave does not alter the environmental conditions by performing a test of algae growth and thermographic measurements.},

  abstract = {The impact of the spectral composition of light on the discoloration of paint pigments has been investigated for the case of lead chromate sulfate, an unstable yellow pigment used by Vincent van Gogh and other painters. With LEDification, museum lighting is moving from using halogen to LED lamps. LED light sources have a significantly different spectral composition than halogen lamps. To understand the impact of these differences on pigment stability, the wavelength dependence of pigment discoloration was determined. Contrary to the expectation that lower wavelength photons induce more damage than higher wavelength ones, UV (394 nm), blue, and cyan light all lead to similar levels of discoloration of a pigment for the same level of radiant power. By understanding this wavelength dependence, it becomes possible to create white light LED lamps with a spectral composition tuned to minimize the degradation effect. An existing LED solution with a modified emission indeed resulted in 30\% less color change in the experiment than halogen. Furthermore, a method is proposed to optimize the LED spectra by tuning to the properties of each specific artifact. Simulations show that this can reduce the damage of the light source by 45\% in specific cases.},

One of the most important parameters is colour difference, which is a consequence of chemical changes in the material. CIE 157:2004 `Control of Damage to Museum Objects by Optical Radiation' classifies museum collections into four groups, according to different levels of light fastness. However, these classes were developed from research using traditional light sources. Even though LED technology is becoming more popular, there is no advanced evaluation of colour fading or a colour change test for contemporary artworks. This study established that the CIE 157:2004 method, based on threshold effective radiant exposure, can be applied to an actual ageing test of ultraviolet-blocked light sources including two types of white LEDs and one traditional halogen lamp. The results also present a colour fading model that can be used in museum LED lighting to predict the colour difference in contemporary photographic materials for short- and long-term exhibition. This study also provides a revised light dosage classification of modern photographic materials for museums. Moreover, the verification studies can be used as a conceptual reference for assessing the damage potential of other art materials under the tunable multi-LED system of the future.},

Having obtained the data, they were used to test the accuracy of prediction for various colour spaces and models. The results clearly indicate that Hunt's 91 model gives the best fit to the visual results of all the models studied. Hunt's 91 has been further refined to improve the fit to the colourfulness results, and this refined model has been designated Hunt-ACAM (ACAM being the Alvey Colour Appearance Model). The error of prediction from Hunt-ACAM is close to the typical error that is seen to occur between individuals' results and the mean visual results. This performance is considered to be very satisfactory, and the model is therefore believed to provide a reasonably accurate way of evaluating colour fidelity for various colour reproduction systems. Various chromatic-adaptation transformations were also compared with three sets of corresponding chromaticities derived from the results of experiments conducted under four conditions of chromatic adaptation. The results are in reasonable agreement with those obtained by Helson et al. [Illum. Eng. 47, 221\textendash 233 (1952)] and Lam and Rigg [Ph.D. thesis, University of Bradford (1985)]. All results indicate that the Bradford and Hunt-ACAM transformations perform the best and the second best, respectively, of all the selected formulae. The current CIE recommendation does not perform as well as expected.},

The parameters studied were (1) D65, D50, white fluorescent, and tungsten light sources, (2) luminance levels of about 40 and 240 cd/m2, (3) five background conditions: white, grey, black, grey with white border, and grey with black border, and (4) two media: luminous colours (displayed on a high-resolution colour monitor) and nonluminous colours (presented in a viewing cabinet). Each colour was assessed by a panel of six or seven observers using a magnitude estimation method. In total, 43,332 estimations were made, and these form the LUTCHI Colour Appearance Data. Data analysis has been carried out to examine the reliability of the experimental results and to understand the effects of the various viewing parameters studied. (Part II of this article describes how the LUTCHI Colour Appearance Data has been used to test the performance of various colour spaces and models.},

  abstract = {The experimental data from this study extends the LUTCHI colour-appearance data to cover transmissive media. Two further experiments were carried out: one used a large cut-sheet transparency viewed using a back-lit illuminator, and another used a 35-mm slide projected onto a white screen. These new data were used to reveal the changes in colour appearance caused by different viewing parameters studied, and to evaluate the predictive accuracy of five uniform colour spaces and colour-appearance models. The results show that Hunt's 91 model (developed to fit earlier experimental results) did not perform as well as it did in the previous studies using nontransmissive media. This implies that there are large differences in perceived colour appearance between transmissive and nontransmissive media viewing conditions. Some modifications were subsequently made to Hunt's 91 model and the predictive accuracy was greatly improved.},

Two further experiments were carried out: one was to check conflicting results found previously, and another was to extend the range of luminance conditions used earlier. In addition, a brightness attribute was added to the original lightness, colourfulness, and hue scales for colour assessment. Experiment I results verified the uncertainties found previously in the comparison between luminous and nonluminous colours, and between the grey background results with and without a white border. Experiment II results revealed the changes in four perceived attributes under six quite different adapting luminances. The results were then used to test five uniform colour spaces and colour-appearance models used in Part II of this paper. Hunt's 91 model gave more accurate predictions of the experimental visual results, in comparison with the other spaces and models. Its predictive error for all attributes studied is within the accuracy of the typical observer.},

A total of 814 test/surround combinations were displayed on high-resolution colour displays. Each was assessed by a panel of five to six observers using a magnitude estimation technique. the results indicate that colours presented on a computer display are affected by simultaneous contrast in a similar way to surface colours. All three colour appearance parameters studied (i.e., lightness, colourfulness, and hue) are affected and these effects are summarized. In general, the results support and add to the findings of the other studies. the Hunt colour appearance model was tested and gave a somewhat poor prediction to this data set.

The visual pigments of ``deep sea'' fish are an exception for these do match the environmental light to give maximum sensitivity. At the low light intensities at which the rods operate, it is the number of photons that go to make upeach element of the image that limits the ability of the eye to discriminate detail and contrast. Chemically induced isomerisation of the visual pigment molecule may cause spurious visual signals that limit the ability of the eye to detect contrasts in very dim light. In bright light the spurious visual signals become insignificant in number compared to the true photon-induced visual signals. Compared to the rods, cone visual pigments do match the spectral properties of the environment exceptthat there appear to be no visual pigments with an absorption maximum beyond the 625 nm porphyropsins in cones. U.V. absorbing pigments are know in invertebrates, birds and fish that live in very shallow water. Animals have photoreceptors in parts of the body other than the eyes. In vertebrates these sites includethe pineal, chromatophores, brain, skin and harderian gland. There is evidence based on immunocytochemistry and action spectra that at least some of the skin and pineal receptors contain visual pigments, but like those of the rods, these do not match the spectral quality of the environmental light.},

In this study, the self-regulation mechanism of pineal circadian rhythm was investigated by culturing chick primary pinealocytes exposed to red light (RL), green light (GL), blue light (BL), white light (WL) and constant darkness (DD), respectively. All illuminations were set up with a photoperiod of 12 light: 12 dark. The 24-h expression profiles of seven core clock genes (cBmal1/2, cClock, cCry1/2, and cPer2/3), cAanat and melatonin showed significant circadian oscillation in all groups, except for the loss of cCry1 rhythm in BL. Compared to WL, GL increased the amplitudes and mesors of positive elements (cClock, cBmal1/2) and reduced those of negative elements (cCry1/2, cPer2/3), in contrast to RL. The temporal patterns of cAanat mRNA and melatonin secretion have always been consistent with the positive genes. Besides, GL advanced the acrophases of the positive elements, cAanat and melatonin, but RL and BL showed the opposite effect. Thereby, GL could promote the secretion of melatonin by enhancing the expressions of positive clock genes and repressing the expressions of negative clock genes.

  abstract = {Under different ordinary qualities of illumination, a given surface retains its chromatic appearance nearly undisturbed after the observer becomes adapted to the change in quality, although the visual stimuli may be quite different for the diverse qualities. This phenomenon, called ``chromatic adaptation'', is customarily assumed to be equivalent to a proportional attenuation of responses that are linearly related to the physical stimuli. Analyses of data obtained recently by three independent experimenters using very different procedures indicate, however, that the hypothesis of a linear relation between the response and the stimulus fails systematically to account for the experimental results within reasonable limits of error. By combining the hypothesis of proportional attenuation and of various nonlinear relations between response and stimulus, most of the systematic errors in accounting for the experimental results can be eliminated. The most successful forms of the nonlinearities associated with the three color-receptor systems in various states of chromatic adaptation are found to be rather similar for the data of all three experiments. In general, the form of the nonlinearity thus deduced is different for each of the three color-receptor systems and, for each, is differently dependent upon the state of chromatic adaptation.

  abstract = {An apparatus is described which facilitates the presentation of pairs of variable colors without variation of luminance. With this instrument, various criteria of visual sensitivity to color difference have been investigated. The standard deviation of color matching was finally adopted as the most reproducible criterion. The test field was two degrees in diameter, divided by a vertical biprism edge, and was viewed centrally with a surrounding field of forty-two degrees diameter uniformly illuminated so as to have a chromaticity similar to that of the I.C.I. Standard Illuminant C (average daylight). The luminance of the test field was maintained constant at 15 millilamberts, and the surrounding field was 7.5 millilamberts. These fields were viewed monocularly through an artificial pupil, 2.6 mm in diameter. Over twenty-five thousand trials at color matching have been recorded for a single observer, and the readings are analyzed in detail and compared with previously available data. The standard deviations of the trials are represented in terms of distance in the standard 1931 I.C.I. chromaticity diagram. These increments of distance are represented as functions of position alongstraight lines in the chromaticity diagram, and also as functions of direction of departure from points representing certain standard chromaticities. Such representations are simpler than the traditional representations of wave-length thresholds and purity thresholds as functions of wave-length, and the accuracy of the representations is improved by this simplicity. Chromaticity discrimination for non-spectral colors is represented simultaneously and on the same basis as for spectral colors. Small, equally noticeable chromaticity differences are represented for all chromaticities and for all kinds of variations by the lengths of the radii of a family of ellipses drawn on the standard chromaticity diagram. These ellipses cannot be transformed into equal-sized circles by any projective transformation of the standard chromaticity diagram. The consistency of these data with the results of other investigators is exhibited in terms of the noticeabilities of wave-length differences in the spectrum and of the noticeabilities of purity differences from a neutral stimulus, as functions of dominant wave-length.},

  abstract = {The evolution of terrestrial vertebrates, starting around 385 million years ago, is an iconic moment in evolution that brings to mind images of fish transforming into four-legged animals. Here, we show that this radical change in body shape was preceded by an equally dramatic change in sensory abilities akin to transitioning from seeing over short distances in a dense fog to seeing over long distances on a clear day. Measurements of eye sockets and simulations of their evolution show that eyes nearly tripled in size just before vertebrates began living on land. Computational simulations of these animal's visual ecology show that for viewing objects through water, the increase in eye size provided a negligible increase in performance. However, when viewing objects through air, the increase in eye size provided a large increase in performance. The jump in eye size was, therefore, unlikely to have arisen for seeing through water and instead points to an unexpected hybrid of seeing through air while still primarily inhabiting water. Our results and several anatomical innovations arising at the same time suggest lifestyle similarity to crocodiles. The consequent combination of the increase in eye size and vision through air would have conferred a 1 million-fold increase in the amount of space within which objects could be seen. The ``buena vista'' hypothesis that our data suggest is that seeing opportunities from afar played a role in the subsequent evolution of fully terrestrial limbs as well as the emergence of elaborated action sequences through planning circuits in the nervous system.},

  abstract = {Scientific research activity is reaching a staggering growth rate, introducing new and compounding existing challenges regarding the quality of peer-review, rise of predatory journals, and larger issues involving academic integrity and fraud stemming from the increased pressure to publish. Blockchain, a distributed ledger technology, is well-suited to address some of the challenges specific to scientific publishing. Companies including ARTiFACTS, Pluto, Orvium, and ScienceMatters-EUREKA, along with academic researchers, are exploring blockchain-based solutions to facilitate research data provenance and workflows, optimize the peer-review process, introduce better incentives, and even create new research journals and platforms utilizing blockchain. Building upon a review of these efforts, we propose a governance framework for scientific publishing based on a consortium blockchain model to create a more efficient means of navigating the publishing process. At the center of this framework is a model that adopts shared governance and validated inclusion via a Democratic Autonomous Organization (DAO). A DAO is an entity wherein the organizational rules are implemented and executed via smart contracts. The DAO will be comprised of participants of validated individuals and organizations who are publishers, editors, peer-reviewers, and citizen scientists to manage and oversee the framework. The framework also maps specifically to the publication workflow of submitting, handling, peer-review, and final editorial decision-making for scientific manuscripts. The goal of this framework is to increase transparency of scientific publishing, create a ``pedigree'' of a manuscript's research life cycle, and democratize the publication process while maintaining the accepted workflow common to scientific publishing by journals.},

  abstract = {Recent computational models of color vision demonstrate that it is possible to achieve exact color constancy over a limited range of lights and surfaces described by linear models. The success of these computational models hinges on whether any sizable range of surface spectral reflectances can be described by a linear model with about three parameters. In the first part of this paper, I analyze two large sets of empirical surface spectral reflectances and examine three conjectures concerning constraints on surface reflectance: (1) that empirical surface reflectances fall within a linear model with a small number of parameters, (2) that empirical surface reflectances fall within a linear model composed of band-limited functions with a small number of parameters, and (3) that the shape of the spectral-sensitivity curves of human vision enhance the fit between empirical surface reflectances and a linear model. I conclude that the first and second conjectures hold for the two sets of spectral reflectances analyzed but that the number of parameters required to model the spectral reflectances is five to seven, not three. A reanalysis of the empirical data that takes human visual sensitivity into account gives more promising results. The linear models derived provide excellent fits to the data with as few as three or four parameters, confirming the third conjecture. The results suggest that constraints on possible surface-reflectance functions and the ``filtering'' properties of the shapes of the spectral-sensitivity curves of photoreceptors can both contribute to color constancy. In the last part of the paper I derive the relation between the number of photoreceptor classes present in vision and the ``filtering'' properties of each class. The results of this analysis reverse a conclusion reached by Barlow: the ``filtering'' properties of human photoreceptors are consistent with a trichromatic visual system that is color constant.},

The literature provides a number of alternative estimation approaches for log models, including ordinary least-squares on ln(y) and generalized linear models. This study examines how well the alternative estimators behave econometrically in terms of bias and precision when the data are skewed or have other common data problems (heteroscedasticity, heavy tails, etc.). No single alternative is best under all conditions examined. The paper provides a straightforward algorithm for choosing among the alternative estimators. Even if the estimators considered are consistent, there can be major losses in precision from selecting a less appropriate estimator.},

In order to take the high computational complexity into account, we derive a split Bregman optimisation for the proposed model. The results show the advantages of the proposed approach compared with a marginal approach on synthetic and real data.},

We used this `natural knock-out' to study the organization of color vision pathways in primates. We review here results from our and other laboratories showing how the primordial dichromatic blue-yellow pathway is characterized by selective connections to short wavelength sensitive cones in the retina and that signals for blue-yellow color vision travel through an ancient part of the subcortical visual pathway called the koniocellular system. Signals serving red-green color vision by contrast are tightly linked to retinal circuits serving high-resolution spatial vision at the fovea and show little sign of specific patterns of connections with medium- and long-wavelength sensitive cones. Routine trichromatic color vision thus is based on converging signals from two quite distinct retinal and subcortical pathways. Keywords: color, neurophysiology, neuroanatomy, primate, evolution.},

The results demonstrate this approach to be a powerful tool for art and heritage professionals when deciding which illumination to use in museums, or which conservation or restoration techniques best maintain the color appearance of the original piece under any illuminant. Spectral imaging technology overcomes the limitations of common area-based point-measurement devices such as spectrophotometers, allowing a local study either pixelwise or by selected areas. To our knowledge, this is the first study available that uses the proposed CIE (Commission Internationale de l\&rsquo;\&Eacute;clairage) light-emitting diode (LED) illuminants in the context of art and heritage science, comparing them with the three main CIE illuminants A, D50, and D65. For this, the corresponding colors under D65 have been calculated using a chromatic adaptation transform analogous to the one in CIECAM02. For the sample studied, the CIE LED illuminants with the lowest average CIEDE2000 color differences from the standard CIE illuminants are LED-V1 for A and LED-V2 for D50 and D65, with 1.23, 1.07, and 1.57 units, respectively.

Russian has two BCCs for blue, sinij `dark blue' and goluboj `light blue'. These language-specific BCCs were reported to enable native Russian speakers to discriminate cross-boundary dark and light blues faster than English speakers (Winawer et al., 2007, PNAS, 4, 7780\textendash 7785). We re-evaluated this finding in two experiments that employed identical tasks as in the cited study. In Experiment 1, Russian and English speakers categorised colours as sinij/goluboj or dark blue/light blue respectively; this was followed by a colour discrimination task. In Experiment 2, Russian speakers initially performed the discrimination task on sinij/goluboj and goluboj/zel\"enyj `green' sets. They then categorised these colours in three frequency contexts with each stimulus presented: (i) an equal number of times (unbiased); more frequent (ii) either sinij or goluboj; (iii) either goluboj or zel\"enyj. We observed a boundary response speed advantage for goluboj/zel\"enyj but not for sinij/goluboj. The frequency bias affected only the sinij/goluboj boundary such that in a lighter context, the boundary shifted towards lighter shades, and vice versa. Contrary to previous research, our results show that in Russian, stimulus discrimination at the lightness-defined blue BCC boundary is not reflected in processing speed. The sinij/goluboj boundary did have a sharper categorical transition than the dark blue/light blue boundary, but it was also affected by frequency and order biases, demonstrating that ``Russian blues'' are less well-structured than previously thought.},

  abstract = {Hue-scaling functions are designed to characterize color appearance by assessing the relative strength of the red versus green and blue versus yellow opponent sensations comprising different hues. However, these judgments can be non-intuitive and may pose difficulties for measurement and analysis. We explored an alternative scaling method based on positioning a dial to represent the relative similarity or distance of each hue from the labeled positions for the opponent categories. The hue-scaling and hue-similarity rating methods were compared for 28 observers. Settings on both tasks were comparable though the similarity ratings showed less inter-observer variability and weaker categorical bias, suggesting that these categorical biases may reflect properties of the task rather than the percepts. Alternatively, properties that are concordant for the two paradigms provide evidence for characteristics that do reflect color appearance. Individual differences on both tasks suggest that color appearance depends on multiple, narrowly tuned color processes, which are inconsistent with conventional color-opponent theory.},

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$>$}It is easier to read dark text on a bright background (positive polarity) than to read bright text on a dark background (negative polarity). This positive-polarity advantage is often linked to pupil size: A bright background induces small pupils, which in turn increases visual acuity. Here we report that pupil size, when manipulated through peripheral brightness, has qualitatively different effects on discrimination of fine stimuli in central vision and detection of faint stimuli in peripheral vision. Small pupils lead to improved discrimination performance, consistent with the positive-polarity advantage, but only for very small stimuli that are at the threshold of visual acuity. In contrast, large pupils lead to improved detection performance. These results are likely due to two pupil-size related factors: Small pupils increase visual acuity, which improves discrimination of fine stimuli; and large pupils increase light influx, which improves detection of faint stimuli. Light scatter is likely also a contributing factor: When a display is bright, light scatter creates a diffuse veil of retinal illumination that reduces image contrast, thus impairing detection performance. We further found that pupil size was larger during the detection task than during the discrimination task, even though both tasks were equally difficult and similar in visual input; this suggests that the pupil may automatically assume an optimal size for the current task. Our results may explain why pupils dilate in response to arousal: This may reflect an increased emphasis on detection of unpredictable danger, which is crucially important in many situations that are characterized by high levels of arousal. Finally, we discuss the implications of our results for the ergonomics of display design.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {Earlier studies suggest that the inferior temporal (IT) cortex of the monkey plays a key role in color discrimination. Here, we examined the quantitative relationship between color judgment in monkeys and the responses of color-selective neurons in the anterior part of the IT cortex (area TE) by comparing neuronal activity and behavior recorded simultaneously while the monkeys performed a color-judgment task. We first compared the abilities of single neurons and monkeys to discriminate color. To calculate a neuron's ability to discriminate color, we computed a neurometric function using receiver-operating-characteristics analysis. We then compared the neural and behavioral thresholds for color discrimination and found that, in general, the neural threshold was higher than the behavioral threshold, although occasionally the reverse was true. Variation in the neural threshold across the color space corresponded well with that of the behavioral threshold. We then calculated the choice probability (CP), which is a measure of the correlation between the trial-to-trial fluctuations in neuronal responses and the monkeys' color judgment. On average, CPs were slightly but significantly greater than 0.5, indicating the activities of these TE neurons correlate positively with the monkeys' color judgment. This suggests that individual color-selective TE neurons only weakly contribute to color discrimination and that a large population of color-selective TE neurons contribute to the performance of color discrimination.},

  abstract = {Heart rate (HR) and normalized pulse volume (NPV) are physiological indices that have been used in a diversity of psychological studies. However, measuring these indices often requires laborious processes. We therefore developed a new smartphone program, named iPhysioMeter, that makes it possible to measure beat-by-beat HR and ln NPV using only a smartphone. We examined its accuracy against conventional laboratory measures. Mental stress tasks were used to alter HR and ln NPV in 12 participants. Bland\textendash Altman analyses revealed negligible proportional bias for HR and ln NPV or for their change values, expressed as {$\Delta$}HR and {$\Delta$}ln NPV. However, a relatively large fixed bias did emerge for ln NPV, as well as a small one for {$\Delta$}ln NPV, although both were within the limits of agreement. These findings suggest that iPhysioMeter can yield valid measures of the absolute level of HR and of relative changes in ln NPV.},

  abstract = {Melanopsin is the photoreceptor molecule of intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells, which serve as the input for various nonvisual behavior and physiological functions fundamental to organisms. The retina, therefore, possess a melanopsin-based nonvisual system in addition to the visual system based on the classical visual photoreceptor molecules. To elucidate the molecular properties of melanopsin, we have exogenously expressed mouse melanopsin in cultured cells. We were able to obtain large amounts of purified mouse melanopsin and conducted a comprehensive spectroscopic study of its photochemical properties. Melanopsin has an absorption maximum at 467 nm, and it converts to a meta intermediate having an absorption maximum at 476 nm. The melanopsin photoreaction is similar to that of squid rhodopsin, exhibiting bistability that results in a photosteady mixture of a resting state (melanopsin containing 11-cis-retinal) and an excited state (metamelanopsin containing all-trans-retinal) upon sustained irradiation. The absorption coefficient of melanopsin is 33000 {$\pm$} 1000 M-1 cm-1, and its quantum yield of isomerization is 0.52; these values are also typical of invertebrate bistable pigments. Thus, the nonvisual system in the retina relies on a type of photoreceptor molecule different from that of the visual system. Additionally, we found a new state of melanopsin, containing 7cis-retinal (extramelanopsin), which forms readily upon long-wavelength irradiation (yellow to red light) and photoconverts to metamelanopsin with short-wavelength (blue light) irradiation. Although it is unclear whether extramelanopsin would have any physiological role, it could potentially allow wavelength-dependent regulation of melanopsin functions.},

Colour classification by the chimpanzee was similar to that in a human observer tested under the same condition. Both the chimpanzee and the human observer divided the colour space into the clusters of a broad area within which a single colour name was applied consistently. Areas of consistent colour naming were separated by narrower areas in which the names applied to the two adjacent areas were used and the response latencies were long.

  abstract = {Summary Human visual perception is both stable and adaptive. Perception of complex objects, such as faces, is shaped by the long-term average of experience as well as immediate, comparative context. Measurements of brain activity have demonstrated corresponding neural mechanisms, including norm-based responses reflective of stored prototype representations, and adaptation induced by the immediately preceding stimulus. Here, we consider the possibility that these apparently separate phenomena can arise from a single mechanism of sensory integration operating over varying timescales. We used fMRI to measure neural responses from the fusiform gyrus while subjects observed a rapid stream of face stimuli. Neural activity at this cortical site was best explained by the integration of sensory experience over multiple sequential stimuli, following a decaying-exponential weighting function. Although this neural activity could be mistaken for immediate neural adaptation or long-term, norm-based responses, it in fact reflected a timescale of integration intermediate to both. We then examined the timescale of sensory integration across the cortex. We found a gradient that ranged from rapid sensory integration~in early visual areas, to long-term, stable representations in higher-level, ventral-temporal cortex. These findings were replicated with a new set of face stimuli and subjects. Our results suggest that a cascade of visual areas integrate sensory experience, transforming highly adaptable responses at~early stages to stable representations at higher levels.},

However, there has been no research to date exploring how gaze-contingent displays can be leveraged for manipulating perceived color. To address this, we conducted two experiments (color matching and sorting) that manipulated peripheral background and object colors to influence the user's color perception. Findings from our color matching experiment suggest that we can use gaze-contingent simultaneous contrast to affect color appearance and that existing color appearance models might not fully predict perceived colors with gaze-contingent presentation. Through our color sorting experiment we demonstrate how gaze-contingent adjustments can be used to enhance color discrimination. Gaze-contingent color holds the promise of expanding the perceived color gamut of existing display technology and enabling people to discriminate color with greater precision.},

The melanopsin photocycle is presently unknown but is independent of the enzymatic photocycle employed by rhodopsin and cone opsins. Recent experiments have demonstrated that red-light exposure potentiates circadian phase-shifting responses to blue-light stimuli, consistent with the hypothesis that melanopsin functions as a bistable photopigment. To further test this hypothesis, we analyzed ipRGC firing activity in response to 480-nm blue light with or without intervening long-wavelength 620-nm red-light stimulation, using in vitro multielectrode array recording of postnatal day 8 to 10 murine retina. Cell-firing responses to 480-nm light were highly reproducible. No significant potentiating or bleaching effect of intervening subthreshold 620-nm light on ipRGC firing to 480-nm light could be discerned. Further physiologic and biochemical analysis of the ipRGC photoreception is required to reconcile the presence of long-wavelength potentiation at the level of the SCN with its absence in light-induced ipRGC firing.},

  abstract = {Even though the theory of trichromacy is sometimes referred to as the Young-Helmholtz theory, arguably the most important person in its development was James Clerk Maxwell (1831\textendash 1878). It seems appropriate to initiate this series of classical articles with Maxwell's (1860) ``On the Theory of Compound Colours, and the Relations of the Colours of the Spectrum.'' This article, which is a paragon of imaginative, precise, and analytic research, made a number of seminal contributions to the study of color, some of which I have listed below. The list is ordered in the same sequence as topics are treated in the article. All unattributed quotes are from the paper. Aims of color research: Maxwell shifted the direction of color research from issues of subjective appearance to the scientifically more profitable study of color mechanisms, by aiming ``to determine the laws of the composition of colors in general, to reduce the number of standard colours to the smallest possible, to discover, if we can, what they are, and to ascertain the relation which the homogeneous light of different parts of the spectrum bears to the standard colours.'' Young's trichromatic theory: Helmholtz wrote, ``Young's theory of the color sensations\ldots{} remained unnoticed until Maxwell directed attention to it.'' Maxwell identified the fundamental aspect of the theory as the projective transformation of the infinite-dimensional space of spectral distributions to a color space of smaller dimensions. He tested the dimensionality of color space with his novel experiment of metameric color matching, i.e., by finding sets of physically distinct lights that have identical color appearance. Linking proposition: Maxweell recognized thut colorspace would be three dimensional if Young's three classes of transducers had the property that ``each nuve acts, not us some have thought, by conveying to the mind the knowledge of the length ofcin undulation of light, or of its periodic time, but simply by being more or less affected by the rays which fall on it. The sensation of each elementary nerve is cupable only of increase or diminution, but no other change.'' The Principle of Univariance gave this statement the physical interpretation that a photopigment can signal the number but not the wavelengths of the quanta absorbed. Representation of colors: As one of the first instanticitions of the linear algebru thut he had invented, Grassmann explicated the postulates necessary for Newtion theory of color mixture. Maxwell adapted the properties of a linear space to write explicitic for equations. All metameric lights were assigned to the same eyuivulence class, and each class was represented by a unique threedimensioncil vector. For gruphicul clarity, colors were shown on a planar chromaticity lriangle whose vrrtices corresponded to the vectors representing the standard colors. Psychophysical method: By using a method when the observer was required only to make judgments of identity versus nonidentity, Maxwell did not have to be concerned with the subjective aspects of possible differences. This may have been the first instance of what Brindley later culled Class A psychophysical experiments. An interesting aspect oj Maxwell's method was that all matches were made to the same standard white, thus ``all the observations were of the same kind.'' A number of studie8-10 have documented that Maxwell and maximum saturution matches give similar results except for test lights in the short-wave part of the spectrum, where Max-well matches give superior results. Trichromators: Maxwell's trichromator, which functioned like a reversed spectroscope, enabled him to independently control the intensity of four lights-a standard white in one field, and three spectrally narrow lights in the other. By this means he was able to measure what we now call color-matching jknctions (CMFs) and chromaticity coordinates. It is worth remembering that prior to this experiment, Helmholz's determination of complementury colors was the most extensive series of measurements on color mixture, and the circular form of the color field proposed by Newton had not been tested. One shortcoming o f Maxwell's trichromutor was that intensity could only be adjusted by means of slit width, which also altered the spectral composition of the light. Despite this limitation, by choosing the standard colors astutely, Maxwell was able to measure CMFs that are in substantial agreement with the CIE functions. Maxwellian view: In the trichromator, the lens was placed so that the source was imaged in the plane of the eye's pupil. The observer saw neither an erect nor an inverted image of the source, but rather afield of uniform illumination. Advantages ofwhut is now termed the Max-wellian view have been described by Westheimer. Chromatic versus brightness sensitivity: There has been much recent debate on the relative sensitivities of the chromatic und luminance systems Cfor references, see Suchtler and Zaidi). The first quantitative treatment of this issue may have been Muxwell's determinution from an unulyvJis of errors, that in his experimental conditions, ``the eye appears to be a more accurate judge of the identity of colour of two parts of the field than of their equal illumination.'' Maxwell spot: The Maxwell spot was first described in this article as best seen on a blue background that replaces a yellow buckground. Maxwell identiJied the appearance of the spot with what is now called the macular pigment, which is confined to the foveal region, and indicated that Haidinger's brushes were phenomenal manifestations of the same cause. Individual differences in color vision: By comparing CMFs of two observers, Maxwell identiJied differences in preretinal ubsorption in the short wavelengths as the main cause of individual differences in color matching. By correlating the relative intensities of different primaries with the visibility of the Maxwell spot, he attributed this absorption to the macular pigment. More recent analyses15-16 have shown that interobserver variubility in color matches is due mainly to individual differences in optical density of lenticular pigment as well as macular pigment, both of which absorb maximally at short wavelengths. Dichromatic vision as a reduced form: Maxwell defined dichromatic vision as a reduced form of trichromatic vision, i.e., ifthe effects ofpreretinal absorption were equal, a dichromat would accept as metamers all matches made by a trichromat. Traditionally, dichromatic vision is defined in terms of copunctul points in u two-dimensional trichromatic chromaticity diagram. The copunctal point is the point of intersection of lines through pairs of chromaticities that are indistinguishable to the dichromat. Maxwell's scheme is more elegant. In a three-dimensional color space, the vector differences ofpairs of colors indistinguishable to a reduction-type dichromat will all be parallel. The three types of dichromatic vision can thus be characterized completely by one confusion vector each, or in Maxwell's terms: ``that colour, the absence of the sensation of which constitutes the defect of the dichromic eye.'' Derivation of cone spectral sensitivities: When the three-dimensional color space is affinely transformed to the three dichromatic confusion vectors as axes, each coordinate is proportional to the excitation of a corresponding independent cone class, and the CMFs are transformed to cone spectral sensitivities. Explicit derivations of Maxwell's procedure can be found in Nuberg and Yustova Judd and Zaidi. There is, of course, much more to this article than just these highlights. Maxwell's other articles on color are worth exploring as well.},

When this system of discs is set in rapid rotation, the sectors of the different colours become indistinguishable, and the whole appears of one uniform tint. The resultant tints of two different combinations of colours may be compared by using a second set of discs of a smaller size, and placing these over the centre of the first set, so as to leave the outer portion of the larger discs exposed. The resultant tint of the first combination will then appear in a ring round that of the second, and may be very carefully compared with it.},

While many methods have been developed over the last years, this problem is still open since no method builds on hypotheses that are universal enough to deal with all possible situations. The proposed approach relies on a physical assumption about the possible set of illuminants and on the selection of grey pixels. Namely, a subset of pixels is automatically selected, which is then projected on the Planckian locus. Then, a simple voting procedure yields a robust estimation of the illuminant. As shown by experiments on two classical databases, the method offers state of the art performances among learning-free methods, at a reasonable computational cost.},

  abstract = {Second only to headache, photophobia is the most debilitating symptom reported by people with migraine. While the melanopsin-containing intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells (ipRGCs) are thought to play a role, how cone and melanopsin signals are integrated in this pathway to produce visual discomfort is poorly understood. We studied 60 people: 20 without headache and 20 each with interictal photophobia from migraine with or without visual aura. Participants viewed pulses of spectral change that selectively targeted melanopsin, the cones, or both and rated the degree of visual discomfort produced by these stimuli while we recorded pupil responses. We examined the data within a model that describes how cone and melanopsin signals are weighted and combined at the level of the retina and how this combined signal is transformed into a rating of discomfort or pupil response. Our results indicate that people with migraine do not differ from headache-free controls in the manner in which melanopsin and cone signals are combined. Instead, people with migraine demonstrate an enhanced response to integrated ipRGC signals for discomfort. This effect of migraine is selective for ratings of visual discomfort, in that an enhancement of pupil responses was not seen in the migraine group, nor were group differences found in surveys of other behaviors putatively linked to ipRGC function (chronotype, seasonal sensitivity, presence of a photic sneeze reflex). By revealing a dissociation in the amplification of discomfort vs. pupil response, our findings suggest a postretinal alteration in processing of ipRGC signals for photophobia in migraine.},

In Part I we repeated that experiment, quantifying the color sensations for each of the many Mondrian areas. In Part II we show that each area's color sensation correlates with a triplet of reflectances measured with photodetectors having the same spectral sensitivities as the cone pigments in the eye. This result provides a description of what the visual system does, but it does not provide a mechanism for how the visual system can do it because the reflectance measurements required the use of a reflectance standard and unchanging illumination. In Part III we describe a model for color sensations that computes three reflectances from the wavelength-radiance distribution without reflectance or illumination standards: hence, it is able to predict the color sensations seen by the observer. The model is able to predict gray, red. yellow, green and blue sensations associated with areas that send identical wavelength-radiance distributions to the eye.},

  abstract = {Research into animal cognitive abilities is increasing quickly and often uses methods where behavioral performance on a task is assumed to represent variation in the underlying cognitive trait. However, because these methods rely on behavioral responses as a proxy for cognitive ability, it is important to validate that the task structure does, in fact, target the cognitive trait of interest rather than non-target cognitive, personality, or motivational traits (construct validity). Although it can be difficult, or impossible, to definitively assign performance to one cognitive trait, one way to validate that task structure is more likely to elicit performance based on the target cognitive trait is to assess the temporal and contextual repeatability of performance. In other words, individual performance is likely to represent an inherent trait when it is consistent across time and across similar or different tasks that theoretically test the same trait. Here, we assessed the temporal and contextual repeatability of performance on tasks intended to test the cognitive trait behavioral flexibility in great-tailed grackles (*Quiscalus mexicanus*). For temporal repeatability, we quantified the number of trials to form a color preference after each of multiple color reversals on a serial reversal learning task. For contextual repeatability, we then compared performance on the serial color reversal task to the latency to switch among solutions on each of two different multi-access boxes. We found that the number of trials to form a preference in reversal learning was repeatable across serial color reversals and the latency to switch a preference was repeatable across color reversal learning and the multi-access box contexts. This supports the idea that the reversal learning task structure elicits performance reflective of an inherent trait, and that reversal learning and solution switching on multi-access boxes similarly reflect the inherent trait of behavioral flexibility.},

  abstract = {Many aspects of visual coding have been successfully predicted by starting from the statistics of natural scenes and then asking how the stimulus could be efficiently represented. We started from the representation of color characterized by uniform color spaces, and then asked what type of color environment they implied. These spaces are designed to represent equal perceptual differences in color discrimination or appearance by equal distances in the space. The relative sensitivity to different axes within the space might therefore reflect the gamut of colors in natural scenes. To examine this, we projected perceptually uniform distributions within the Munsell, CIE L*u*v* or CIE L*a*b* spaces into cone-opponent space. All were elongated along a bluish-yellowish axis reflecting covarying signals along the L\textendash M and S\textendash (L+M) cardinal axes, a pattern typical (though not identical) to many natural environments. In turn, color distributions from environments were more uniform when projected into the CIE L*a*b* perceptual space than when represented in a normalized cone-opponent space. These analyses suggest the bluish-yellowish bias in environmental colors might be an important factor shaping chromatic sensitivity, and also suggest that perceptually uniform color metrics could be derived from natural scene statistics and potentially tailored to specific environments.},

Two basic feeding modes prevail: (1) silhouetting prey from below against the surface background light; and (2) contrasting prey against other fields of view, which are more monochromatic. Fishes that silhouette prey from below possess a single visual pigment matched to the spectral distribution of downwelling light. This maximizes the contrast between the brighter background and darker target. To predators that view prey in the horizontal fleld, their targets may appear either darker or brighter than the background. The photocontrast of a nonreflective target is maximized by a class of cones with a matching visual pigment. But the contrast of reflective (``bright'') targets is enhanced by visual pigments offset from the spectral distribution of the monochromatic blue background. Thus, the evolutionary selection of multiple photopic systems, and of color vision itself, is probably related to the maximization of visual contrast against monochromatic backgrounds.},

Beginning with an overview of the atmosphere and its components, it introduces the physics that drive weather systems before setting those principles in the context of specific systems of differing scales and latitudes. Finally, the text draws this information together in relation to the problem of anthropogenic climate change. Fundamentals of Weather and Climate is enhanced by extensive pedagogical features including end-of-chapter questions, key points, and custom-drawn illustrations that enable students to more easily visualize the processes and interactions described. A Companion Website offers resources for students and instructors.

All subjects underwent standard automated perimetry (SAP) and SWAP (using a Humphrey field analyzer; 24-2 presentation pattern).

  abstract = {Organic colouring matters are faded by absorbed ultraviolet and visible radiation up to a critical wavelength, above which radiation is non-actinic even if strongly absorbed. This wavelength is generally related to the normal light fastness of the colouring matter, ``normal'' referring to the substrate for which it was originally developed, e.g. vat dyes on cotton, disperse dyes on acetate rayon. The critical wavelength decreases as the resistance to fading increases, being in the red when the light fastness is 1\textendash 2 (minimum) and in the blue when it is 6\textendash 8 (maximum); there are, however, some exceptions to this rule. As long-wave radiations preponderate in daylight and as the absorption bands are usually strongest in the visible spectrum, fugitive organic colouring matters are mainly faded by visible light, whilst those of high normal light fastness can in general be faded only by ultraviolet, violet, and blue light. The differences between the composition of actinic radiation constituting daylight and that emitted by the enclosed carbon arc have been shown to be relatively unimportant as a possible source of gross anomalies in light fastness testing based on comparison with light fastness standards. These differences do, however, render meaningless any attempts to equate one hour's lamp exposure with so many hours' sunshine.},

  abstract = {Background Atrial fibrillation (AF) is common and associated with adverse health outcomes. Timely detection of AF can be challenging using traditional diagnostic tools. Smartphone use is increasing and may provide an inexpensive and user-friendly means to diagnoseAF. Objective To test the hypothesis that a smartphone-based application could detect an irregular pulse fromAF. Methods Seventy-six adults with persistent AF were consented for participation in our study. We obtained pulsatile time series recordings before and after cardioversion using an iPhone 4S camera. A novel smartphone application conducted real-time pulse analysis using 2 statistical methods: root mean square of successive RR difference (RMSSD/mean) and Shannon entropy (ShE). We examined the sensitivity, specificity, and predictive accuracy of both algorithms using the 12-lead electrocardiogram as the gold standard. Results RMSDD/mean and ShE were higher in participants in AF than in those with sinus rhythm. The 2 methods were inversely related to AF in regression models adjusting for key factors including heart rate and blood pressure (beta coefficients per SD increment in RMSDD/mean and ShE were-0.20 and-0.35; P\&lt;.001). An algorithm combining the 2 statistical methods demonstrated excellent sensitivity (0.962), specificity (0.975), and accuracy (0.968) for beat-to-beat discrimination of an irregular pulse during AF from sinus rhythm. Conclusions In a prospectively recruited cohort of 76 participants undergoing cardioversion for AF, we found that a novel algorithm analyzing signals recorded using an iPhone 4S accurately distinguished pulse recordings during AF from sinus rhythm. Data are needed to explore the performance and acceptability of smartphone-based applications for AF detection.},

  abstract = {There is still much to understand about the color processing mechanisms in the brain and the transformation from cone-opponent representations to perceptual hues. Moreover, it is unclear which areas(s) in the brain represent unique hues. We propose a hierarchical model inspired by the neuronal mechanisms in the brain for local hue representation, which reveals the contributions of each visual cortical area in hue representation. Local hue encoding is achieved through incrementally increasing processing nonlinearities beginning with cone input. Besides employing nonlinear rectifications, we propose multiplicative modulations as a form of nonlinearity. Our simulation results indicate that multiplicative modulations have significant contributions in encoding of hues along intermediate directions in the MacLeod-Boynton diagram and that model V4 neurons have the capacity to encode unique hues. Additionally, responses of our model neurons resemble those of biological color cells, suggesting that our model provides a novel formulation of the brain's color processing pathway.},

While both adults and children show cognitive and affective benefits after nature exposure, it is unknown whether children demonstrate nature preferences. In the current study, 4-to-11-year-old children and their parents rated their preferences for images of nature and urban scenes. Parents' preferences matched those of a normative adult sample. However, children demonstrated robust preferences for urban over natural environments, and those urban preferences significantly decreased with age. Nature exposure around the home and nature-related activities, as reported by parents, did not predict children's preferences. Children with more nearby nature, however, had lower reported inattentiveness, but interestingly, this was unrelated to children's preferences for nature. These results provide an important step into future research on the role of preference in how children and adults benefit from nature.},

A variety of illusions have been attributed to contextual processing \textemdash{} from orientation tilt effects to chromatic induction phenomena, but their neural underpinnings remain poorly understood. Here, we present a recurrent network model of classical and extra-classical receptive fields that is constrained by the anatomy and physiology of the visual cortex. A key feature of the model is the postulated existence of two spatially disjoint near-vs. far-extra-classical regions with complementary facilitatory and suppressive contributions to the classical receptive field. The model accounts for a variety of contextual illusions, reveals commonalities between seemingly disparate phenomena, and helps organize them into a novel taxonomy. It explains how center-surround interactions may shift from attraction to repulsion in tilt effects, and from contrast to assimilation in induction phenomena. The model further explains enhanced perceptual shifts generated by a class of patterned background stimuli that activate the two opponent extra-classical regions cooperatively. Overall, the ability of the model to account for the variety and complexity of contextual illusions provides computational evidence for a novel canonical circuit that is shared across visual modalities.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {The majority of decisions in the building design process are taken in the early design stage. This delicate phase presents the greatest opportunity to obtain high performance buildings, but pertinent performance information is needed for designers to be able to deal with multidisciplinary and contrasting objectives. In the present work, an integrative approach for the early stages of building design is proposed to obtain detailed information on energy efficient envelope configurations. By means of genetic algorithms, a multi-objective search was performed with the aim of minimising the energy need for heating, cooling and lighting of a case study. The investigation was carried out for an open space office building by varying number, position, shape and type of windows and the thickness of the masonry walls. The search was performed through an implementation of the NSGA-II algorithm, which was made capable of exchanging information with the EnergyPlus building energy simulation tool. The analyses were conducted both in absence and in presence of an urban context in the climates of Palermo, Torino, Frankfurt and Oslo. In addition, a preliminary analysis on the Pareto front solutions was performed to investigate the statistical variation of the values assumed by the input variables in all the non-dominated solutions. For the analysed case study, results highlighted a small overall Window-to-Wall Ratio (WWR) of the building in all locations. Pareto front solutions were characterised by low WWR values especially in east, west and north exposed fa\c{c}ades. The area of the south facing windows was higher compared to the other orientations and characterised by a higher variability.},

In fruit with chlorophyll content more than 5 nmol/cm2, the reflectance near 678 nm was insensitive to a variation in chlorophylls, whereas, reflectance in the bands 550 \'A/650 nm and 690 \'A/705 nm remained sensitive to chlorophyll content in a wide range of its variation. The reflectance ratios, R800/ R700 and R800/R640, were directly proportional to total chlorophyll content ranging from 0.4 to 11 nmol/cm2 (r2  /0.93). The reflectance in the band 520 \'A/530 nm was found to be dependent mostly on carotenoids absorption. The index R800(1/R520(/1/R700) was suggested for estimation of carotenoid content in the range 0.6 \'A/4.5 nmol/cm2. The index for assessment of a carotenoid/chlorophyll ratio was proposed in the form, (R480(/R678)/R800. Reflectance in the green region of the spectrum proved to be sensitive to anthocyanin content. The index R800(1/R550(/1/R700) was developed to estimate anthocyanin content in peel ranging from 2.5 to 50 nmol/cm2; the determination coefficient of the index with anthocyanin content was higher than 0.93.},

We examined various image statistics and their role in categorizing the color of leaves. Our subjects categorized photographs of autumn leaves and versions that were manipulated, including: randomly repositioned pixels, leaves uniformly colored with their mean color, leaves that were made by reflecting the original leaves' chromaticity distribution about their mean (``flipped leaves''), and simple patches colored with the mean colors of the original leaves. We trained a linear classifier with a set of image statistics in order to predict the category that each object was assigned to. Our results show that the mean hue of an object is highly predictive of the natural object's color category ({$>$}90\% accuracy) and observers' choices are consistent with their use of unique yellow as a decision boundary for classification. The flipped leaves produced consistent changes in color categorization that are possibly explained by an interaction between the color distributions and the texture of the leaves.},

The form of attention best understood at the cellular level is when stimuli at a given location in the visual field must be selected (space-based attention). In contrast, fewer single-unit recording studies have so far explored the cellular mechanisms of attention operating on individual stimulus features, specifically when one feature (e.g., color) of an object must guide behavioral responses while a second feature (e.g., shape) of the same object is potentially interfering and therefore must be ignored. Here we show that activity of neurons in macaque area V4 can underlie the selection of elemental object features and their ``translation'' into a categorical format that can directly contribute to the control of the animal's behavior.},

Specifically, we argue that individual differences in EFs, as measured with simple laboratory tasks, (1) show both unity and diversity (different EFs are correlated yet separable); (2) reflect substantial genetic contributions; (3) are related to various clinically and societally important phenomena; and (4) show some developmental stability.},

  abstract = {Museums hold a wide variety of cultural properties and they organize exhibitions for the public. In history museums, a number of interpretive materials are necessary to present a specific historical theme. However, due to limitation of space, the number of displayed materials is severely restricted. There are various types of guidance systems in museums, however, most systems have not yet responded to visitors' needs. Therefore, a useful guidance system is necessary to satisfy their needs and also to enhance their understandings of the exhibitions. In order to create such guidance system, applications of imaging technology can become a solution to overcome these restrictions and meet the requirements. In this research, a visual guidance system using a data projector was examined in the National Museum of Japanese History. In the kimono (traditional Japanese clothing) section, the projector was used to simulate color changes of the materials under different illuminants. The projector also highlighted areas where annotations were featured in the kimono. The validity of using the projector system was confirmed by results from an interview survey. To further develop this visual guidance system, an augmented reality system consisted of cooperation between the projector and a digital camera was also examined.},

  abstract = {We used color contrast adaptation to examine the chromatic and  contrast selectivity of central color mechanisms. Adaptation to a field  whose color varies along a single axis of color space induces a  selective loss in sensitivity to the adapting axis. The resulting  changes in color appearance are consistent with mechanisms formed by  different linear combinations of the cone signals. We asked whether the  visual system could also adjust to higher-order variations in the  adapting stimulus, by adapting observers to interleaved variations  along both the L versus M and the S versus LM cardinal axes. The  perceived hue of test stimuli was then measured with an asymmetric  matching task. Frequency analysis of the hue shifts revealed weak but  systematic hue rotations away from each cardinal axis and toward the  diagonal intermediate axes. Such shifts could arise if the adapted  channels include mechanisms with narrow chromatic selectivity, as some  physiological recordings suggest, but could also reflect how adaptation  alters the contrast response function. In either case they imply the  presence of more than two mechanisms within the chromatic plane. In a  second set of measurements, we adapted to either the L versus M or the  S versus LM axis alone and tested whether the changes in hue could be  accounted for by changes in relative contrast along the two axes. For  high contrasts the hue biases are larger than the contrast changes  predict. This dissociation implies that the contrast and hue changes  are not carried by a common underlying signal, and could arise if the  contrast along a single color direction is encoded by more than one  mechanism with different contrast sensitivities or if different subsets  of channels encode contrast and hue. Such variations in contrast  sensitivity are also consistent with physiological recordings of  cortical neurons.},

  abstract = {Most wavelengths change hue when mixed with white light. These changes, known as the Abney effect, have been extensively studied to characterize nonlinearities in the neural coding of color, but their potential function remains obscure. We measured the Abney effect in a new way\textemdash by varying the bandwidth of the spectrum rather than mixing with white\textemdash and this leads to a new interpretation of the role of nonlinear responses in color appearance. Because of the eye's limited spectral sensitivity, increasing the bandwidth of a spectrum changes the relative responses in the three classes of cone receptor and thus would change hue if the percept were tied to a fixed cone ratio. However, we found that hue is largely independent of bandwidth and thus constant for a constant peak wavelength for stimuli with Gaussian spectra. This suggests that color appearance is compensated for the eye's spectral filtering, and that this compensation embodies specific perceptual inferences about how natural spectra vary. When a wavelength is instead diluted with white light\textemdash which does not bias the cone ratios\textemdash then the same compensation predicts changes in hue because the ``right'' response is made to the ``wrong'' stimulus. This model generates constant hue loci that are qualitatively consistent with measures of the Abney effect and provides a novel functional account of such effects in color appearance, in which postreceptoral responses are adjusted so that constant hue percepts are tied to consistent physical properties of the environment rather than consistent physiological properties such as the cone ratios.},

  abstract = {In 1789, when neither the physical basis of hue nor the retinal basis of color perception was established, the mathematician Gaspard Monte stated firmly that our color perceptions do not depend on the absolute value of the physical variable, but are influenced by the context and in particular by our estimate of the illuminant. He used this insight to explain color contrast effects and the Paradox of Monge (the desaturation of red objects seen through a red filter). He proposed that we can estimate the chromaticity of the illuminant in any scene because all surfaces reflect to us varying mixtures of (i) the body color and (ii) a specular component that represents the illuminant. He also realized that white objects have a special property: Provided that they are illuminated by a single illuminant, such objects exhibit no variation in chromaticity across their surface. Thus at least one of the unique hues exists as an external reference on which observers can agree. It is suggested that other unique hues may also have a basis in the external world.},

  abstract = {On several paintings by artists of the end of the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th Century a darkening of the original yellow areas, painted with the chrome yellow pigment (PbCrO4, PbCrO4{$\cdot$}xPbSO4, or PbCrO4{$\cdot$}xPbO) is observed. The most famous of these are the various Sunflowers paintings Vincent van Gogh made during his career. In the first part of this work, we attempt to elucidate the degradation process of chrome yellow by studying artificially aged model samples. In view of the very thin (1-3 {$\mu$}m) alteration layers that are formed, high lateral resolution spectroscopic methods such as microscopic X-ray absorption near edge ({$\mu$}-XANES), X-ray fluorescence spectrometry ({$\mu$}-XRF), and electron energy loss spectrometry (EELS) were employed. Some of these use synchrotron radiation (SR). Additionally, microscopic SR X-ray diffraction (SR {$\mu$}-XRD), {$\mu$}-Raman, and mid-FTIR spectroscopy were employed to completely characterize the samples. The formation of Cr(III) compounds at the surface of the chrome yellow paint layers is particularly observed in one aged model sample taken from a historic paint tube (ca. 1914). About two-thirds of the chromium that is present at the surface has reduced from the hexavalent to the trivalent state. The EELS and {$\mu$}-XANES spectra are consistent with the presence of Cr2O3{$\cdot$}2H2O (viridian). Moreover, as demonstrated by {$\mu$}-XANES, the presence of another Cr(III) compound, such as either Cr2(SO4)3{$\cdot$}H2O or (CH3CO2)7Cr3(OH)2 [chromium(III) acetate hydroxide], is likely.},

Methods are given also for the calculation of the spectral irradiation curve for any elevation above sea level and for any air mass, and these methods lead to proposed standard curves to be used in engineering calculations dealing with direct sunlight at sea level. These curves are checked against independent data on total irradiation, ultraviolet irradiation, illumination, and color temperature. In all cases, the agreement between calculated and experimental results gives confidence in the validity of the proposed curves for various engineering applications.},

Therefore, standard colorimetry is based on three variables (X, Y, Z). Dichromats only have two types of functional cones due to genetic factors. The main consequences are that dichromats (1) confuse colors that can only be discriminated by the response of the type of cone they lack and (2) make errors when naming colors. Chromaticity diagrams can be used to specify dichromats' color confusions. Confusion points represent imaginary stimuli that only activate L, M, or S cones. Confusion lines radiate from confusion points and represent pseudoisochromatic stimuli (i.e., colors confused by the corresponding type of dichromat if presented at an appropriate intensity). Dichromat's color appearance models have been developed to simulate the colors supposedly seen by dichromats, and there exist color simulation tools that implement some of those models.},

In this study, we compared color constancy for a 3-D miniature room (a real scene consisting of actual objects) and 2-D still images of that room presented on a monitor using three viewing methods: binocular viewing, monocular viewing, and head movement. We found that color constancy was better for the 3-D room; however, color constancy for the 2-D image improved when the viewing method caused the scene to be perceived more like a 3-D scene. Separate measurements of the perceptual 3-D effect of each viewing method also supported these results. An additional experiment comparing a miniature room and its image with and without texture suggested that surface texture of scene objects contributes to color constancy.},

However, we know little about how observers make judgments of the surface color of glossy objects, particularly in complex lighting environments that introduce complex spatial patterns of chromatic variation across an object's surface. To address this question, we measured thresholds for reflectance discrimination using computer-rendered stimuli under environmental illumination. In Experiment 1, we found that glossiness and shape had small effects on discrimination thresholds. Importantly, discrimination ellipses extended along the direction in which the chromaticities in the environmental illumination spread. In Experiment 2, we also found that the observers' abilities to judge surface colors were worse in lighting environments with an atypical chromatic distribution.},

Here, projections were visualized and mapped following intraocular injection of cholera toxin B subunit. Tissue was processed using standard procedures applied to 30 {$\mu$}m free-floating sections with diaminobenzidine as the chromogen. The mouse retina projects to {$\sim$}46 brain regions, including 14 not previously described in this species. These include two amygdaloid nuclei, the horizontal limb of the diagonal band, the paraventricular hypothalamic nucleus, several visual thalamic nuclei, the paranigral nucleus, several pretectal nuclei, and the dorsal cortex of the inferior colliculus. Dense retinal patches were also observed in a narrow portion of the ipsilateral intermediate layer of the superior colliculus. The superior fasciculus of the accessory optic tract, which innervates the medial terminal nucleus, was also determined to be a terminal zone throughout its length. The results are compared with previous descriptions of projections from mouse intrinsically photoreceptive retinal ganglion cells, and with data from the hamster, Nile grass rat, and laboratory rat. The retinal projection patterns are similar in all four species, although there are many differences with respect to the details. The specific visual functions of most retinorecipient areas are unknown, but there is substantial convergence of retinal projections onto regions concerned with olfaction and audition. J. Comp.

In this approach we first solve the general form of this problem: We calculate the set of all possible surface reflectances, called the metamer set, and then choose a member from this set. Three possibilities in choosing a single reflectance are described here. First, we assume that all reflectances are equally likely and minimize worst-case error. Second, we adopt the assumption that reflectances follow a normal probability distribution and maximize this probability. Finally, we assume that reflectances are smooth and maximize this property. The results of our experiments show that there is significant benefit from the proposed approach in terms of the accuracy of the estimation compared with that of standard estimation methods. Moreover, the present approach introduces a notion of robustness of estimates in the form of error bars.},

Countless studies have revealed mental processes -- like those underlying our choices, beliefs, judgments, intuitions, etc. -- which people do not notice or report, and these findings have had a widespread influence on the theory and application of psychological science. However, the interpretation of these findings is uncertain. Making an analogy to perceptual consciousness research, I argue that much of the unconsciousness of high-level cognition is plausibly due to internal inattentional blindness: missing an otherwise consciously-accessible internal event because your attention was elsewhere. In other words, rather than being structurally unconscious, many higher mental processes might instead be "preconscious", and would become conscious if a person attended to them. I synthesize existing indirect evidence for this claim, argue that it is a foundational and largely untested assumption in many applied interventions (such as therapy and mindfulness practices), and suggest that, with careful experimentation, it could form the basis for a long-sought-after science of introspection training.},

Here, we report that it also renders the SCN responsive to visual images. We map spatial receptive fields (RFs) for SCN neurons and find that only a minority are excited (or inhibited) by light from across the scene as expected for irradiance detectors. The most commonly encountered units have RFs with small excitatory centers, combined with very extensive inhibitory surrounds that reduce their sensitivity to global changes in light in favor of responses to spatial patterns. Other units have larger excitatory RF centers, but these always cover a coherent region of visual space, implying visuotopic order at the single-unit level. Approximately 75\% of light-responsive SCN units modulate their firing according to simple spatial patterns (drifting or inverting gratings) without changes in irradiance. The time-averaged firing rate of the SCN is modestly increased under these conditions, but including spatial contrast did not significantly alter the circadian phase resetting efficiency of light. Our data indicate that the SCN contains information about irradiance and spatial patterns. This newly appreciated sensory capacity provides a mechanism by which behavioral and physiological systems downstream of the SCN could respond to visual images [5].},

  abstract = {The relationship between colour and form has been a long standing issue in visual science. A picture of functional segregation and topographic clustering emerges from anatomical and electrophysiological studies in animals, as well as by brain imaging studies in human. However, one of the many roles of chromatic information is to support form perception, and in some cases it can do so in a way superior to achromatic (luminance) information. On the other hand, form seems a necessary prerequisite for the computation and assignment of colour across space, and there are several examples in which the colour of an object can be influenced by its form. Chromatic information can support form perception almost as equally well as luminance information can, both at an early, contour-detection stage, as well as in late, higher stages involving spatial integration and the perception of global shapes. Pure chromatic contrast can also support several visual illusions related to form-perception. Electrophysiological studies have revealed neurons in the visual brain able to signal contours determined by pure chromatic contrast, the spatial tuning of which is similar to that of neurons carrying luminance information. It seems that, especially at an early stage, form is processed by several, independent systems that interact with each other, each one having different tuning characteristics in colour space. At later processing stages, mechanisms able to combine information coming from different sources emerge. A clear interaction between colour and form is manifested by the fact that colour-form contingencies can be observed in various perceptual phenomena such as adaptation aftereffects and illusions. Such an interaction suggests a possible early binding between these two attributes, something that has been verified by both electrophysiological and fMRI studies.},

  abstract = {In addition to rods and cones, the human retina contains light-sensitive ganglion cells that express melanopsin, a photopigment with signal transduction mechanisms similar to that of invertebrate rhabdomeric photopigments (IRP). Like fly rhodopsins, melanopsin acts as a dual-state photosensitive flip-flop in which light drives both phototransduction responses and chromophore photoregeneration that bestows independence from the retinoid cycle required by rods and cones to regenerate photoresponsiveness following bleaching by light. To explore the hypothesis that melanopsin in humans expresses the properties of a bistable photopigment in vivo we used the pupillary light reflex (PLR) as a tool but with methods designed to study invertebrate photoreceptors. We show that the pupil only attains a fully stabilized state of constriction after several minutes of light exposure, a feature that is consistent with typical IRP photoequilibrium spectra. We further demonstrate that previous exposure to long wavelength light increases, while short wavelength light decreases the amplitude of pupil constriction, a fundamental property of IRP difference spectra. Modelling these responses to invertebrate photopigment templates yields two putative spectra for the underlying R and M photopigment states with peaks at 481 nm and 587 nm respectively. Furthermore, this bistable mechanism may confer a novel form of ``photic memory'' since information of prior light conditions is retained and shapes subsequent responses to light. These results suggest that the human retina exploits fly-like photoreceptive mechanisms that are potentially important for the modulation of non-visual responses to light and highlights the ubiquitous nature of photoswitchable photosensors across living organisms.},

  abstract = {In mammals, nonvisual responses to light have been shown to involve intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells (ipRGC) that express melanopsin and that are modulated by input from both rods and cones. Recent in vitro evidence suggests that melanopsin possesses dual photosensory and photoisomerase functions, previously thought to be a unique feature of invertebrate rhabdomeric photopigments. In cultured cells that normally do not respond to light, heterologous expression of mammalian melanopsin confers light sensitivity that can be restored by prior stimulation with appropriate wavelengths. Using three different physiological and behavioral assays, we show that this in vitro property translates to in vivo, melanopsin-dependent nonvisual responses. We find that prestimulation with long-wavelength light not only restores but enhances single-unit responses of SCN neurons to 480-nm light, whereas the long-wavelength stimulus alone fails to elicit any response. Recordings in Opn4-/- mice confirm that melanopsin provides the main photosensory input to the SCN, and furthermore, demonstrate that melanopsin is required for response enhancement, because this capacity is abolished in the knockout mouse. The efficiency of the light-enhancement effect depends on wavelength, irradiance, and duration. Prior long-wavelength light exposure also enhances short-wavelength\textemdash induced phase shifts of locomotor activity and pupillary constriction, consistent with the expression of a photoisomerase-like function in nonvisual responses to light.},

Colour shifts were specified in terms of a modified Brunswik ratio (BR). Higher values of BR were associated with longer adaptation periods but only when the larger background was used. Supplementary experiments showed that the changes in colour appearance were related to a slight shift in the perceived colour of the background. The timing of the colour shifts are modelled in terms of cone opponent responses. High values of BR correspond to almost complete von Kries adaptation in all three cone types.},

Most efforts to understand neural activity during well-learned tasks focus on cognitive computations and task-related movements. We wondered whether task-performing animals explore a broader movement landscape and how this impacts neural activity. We characterized movements using video and other sensors and measured neural activity using widefield and two-photon imaging. Cortex-wide activity was dominated by movements, especially uninstructed movements not required for the task. Some uninstructed movements were aligned to trial events. Accounting for them revealed that neurons with similar trial-averaged activity often reflected utterly different combinations of cognitive and movement variables. Other movements occurred idiosyncratically, accounting for trial-by-trial fluctuations that are often considered `noise'. This held true throughout task-learning and for extracellular Neuropixels recordings that included subcortical areas. Our observations argue that animals execute expert decisions while performing richly varied, uninstructed movements that profoundly shape neural activity.},

  abstract = {For computational methods aiming to reproduce colour names that are meaningful to speakers of different languages, the mapping between perceptual and linguistic aspects of colour is a problem of central information processing. This thesis advances the field of computational colour communication within different languages in five main directions. First, we show that web-based experimental methodologies offer considerable advantages in obtaining a large number of colour naming responses in British and American English, Greek, Russian, Thai and Turkish. We continue with the application of machine learning methods to discover criteria in linguistic, behavioural and geometric features of colour names that distinguish classes of colours. We show that primary colour terms do not form a coherent class, whilst achromatic and basic classes do. We then propose and evaluate a computational model trained by human responses in the online experiment to automate the assignment of colour names in different languages across the full three-dimensional colour gamut. Fourth, we determine for the first time the location of colour names within a physiologically-based cone excitation space through an unconstrained colour naming experiment using a calibrated monitor under controlled viewing conditions. We show a good correspondence between online and offline datasets; and confirm the validity of both experimental methodologies for estimating colour naming functions in laboratory and real-world monitor settings. Finally, we present a novel information theoretic measure, called dispensability, for colour categories that predicts a gradual scale of basicness across languages from both web- and laboratory- based unconstrained colour naming datasets. As a result, this thesis contributes experimental and computational methodologies towards the development of multilingual colour communication schemes.},

  abstract = {The increased use of self-luminous displays, especially in the evening prior to bedtime, has been associated with melatonin suppression, delayed sleep and sleep curtailment. The present study set out to investigate whether the Night Shift application provided by Apple Inc. for use on its portable electronic devices is effective for reducing acute melatonin suppression, a well-established marker of circadian phase. Participants experienced four experimental conditions: a dim light control, a high circadian stimulus true positive intervention and two Night Shift interventions delivering low and high correlated colour temperature light from the devices. Melatonin suppression did not significantly differ between the two Night Shift interventions, which indicates that changing the spectral composition of self-luminous displays without changing their brightness settings may be insufficient for preventing impacts on melatonin suppression.},

Twenty-four participants (12 adolescents, 12 adults) were exposed to three lighting conditions during successive 4-h study nights that were separated by at least one week. In addition to a dim light ({$<$}5\,lux) control, participants were exposed to two light spectra (warm (2700\,K) and cool (5600\,K)) delivering a circadian stimulus of 0.25 at eye level. Repeated measures analysis of variance revealed a significant main effect of exposure duration, indicating that a longer duration exposure suppressed melatonin to a greater degree. The analysis further revealed a significant main effect of spectrum and a significant interaction between spectrum and participant age. For the adolescents, but not the adults, melatonin suppression was significantly greater after exposure to the 5600\,K intervention (43\%) compared to the 2700\,K intervention (29\%), suggesting an increased sensitivity to short-wavelength radiation. These results will be used to extend the model of human circadian phototransduction to incorporate factors such as exposure duration and participant age to better predict effective circadian stimulus.},

  abstract = {Appearance of a color stimulus is significantly affected by the contrast between its luminance and the luminance of the background. In the present study, we used stimuli evenly distributed on the CIE-xy chromaticity diagram to examine how luminance contrast affects neural representation of color in V4 and the anterior inferior temporal (AITC) and posterior inferior temporal (PITC) color areas (Banno et al., 2011). The activities of single neurons were recorded from monkeys performing a visual fixation task, and the effects of luminance contrast on the color selectivity of individual neurons and their population responses were systematically examined by comparing responses to color stimuli that were brighter or darker than the background. We found that the effects of luminance contrast differed considerably across V4 and the PITC and AITC. In both V4 and the PITC, the effects of luminance contrast on the population responses of color-selective neurons depended on color. In V4, the size of the effect was largest for blue and cyan, whereas in the PITC, the effect gradually increased as the saturation of the color stimulus was reduced, and was especially large with neutral colors (white, gray, black). The pattern observed in the PITC resembles the effect of luminance contrast on color appearance, suggesting PITC neurons are closely involved in the formation of the perceived appearance of color. By contrast, the color selectivities of AITC neurons were little affected by luminance contrast, indicating that hue and saturation of color stimuli are represented independently of luminance contrast in the AITC.},

  abstract = {What makes a colored image, e.g. an abstract painting or a landscape, look pleasing? We hypothesized that a preference for complex color compositions, such as paintings and images of natural scenes, might be related to how natural the colors are perceived. We tested this possibility with two experiments in which the degree of naturalness of images was manipulated by rotating their color gamut rigidly in the color space CIELAB. This changed just the hue composition, but preserved saturation and lightness. In the first experiment we obtained individual scaling curves for perceived naturalness and for preference as a function of the angle of gamut rotation for a small set of images. The naturalness and preference scaling curves were found to be largely similar and their maxima were close to the original image. In the second experiment, we tested whether this effect generalized to a larger set of images. We used a simultaneous 5AFC procedure where in each trial participants had to select the most natural or the most preferred image from five different rotations of the color gamut. The results confirmed the first experiment and showed that, in general, the images perceived as the more natural tend to be the ones that are preferred. Together these results show that perceived naturalness and preference are indeed perceptually closely related and may be driven by related mechanisms.},

The aim of the present work was to assess psychophysically the number of basis functions necessary to reproduce entire natural outdoor scenes. Hyperspectral images of 20 such scenes were each subjected to a principal component analysis and then reproduced with a variable number of basis functions. The quality of the color approximation under daylight illumination was quantified theoretically in CIELAB space and psychophysically by spatial and temporal two-alternative forced-choice measurements in which the original and the approximated images were compared on a calibrated color monitor. Although five basis functions produced on average unit error in CIELAB space, original images were visually indistinguishable from their approximations only if there were at least eight basis functions. The combination of the spectral diversity of the natural world and the observed levels of color discrimination suggest that estimates of the minimum number of basis functions necessary to reproduce natural scenes may need to be revised upward.},

Unlike the changes in time and their consequences for color appearance and constancy, the spatial variations of local illumination color in natural scenes have received relatively little attention. The aim of the present work was to characterize these spatial variations by spectral imaging. Hyperspectral radiance images were obtained from 30 rural and urban scenes in which neutral probe spheres were embedded. The spectra of the local illumination at 17 sample points on each sphere in each scene were extracted and a total of 1904 chromaticity coordinates and correlated color temperatures (CCTs) derived. Maximum differences in chromaticities over spheres and over scenes were similar. When data were pooled over scenes, CCTs ranged from 3000 K to 20,000 K, a variation of the same order of magnitude as that occurring over the day. Any mechanisms that underlie stable surface color perception in natural scenes need to accommodate these large spatial variations in local illumination color.},

Here we used immunohistochemistry to study the morphology, density, distribution, and synaptic connectivity of melanopsin-expressing ganglion cells in four post mortem human donor retinas. Two types of melanopsin-expressing ganglion cells were distinguished based on their dendritic stratification near either the outer or the inner border of the inner plexiform layer. Outer stratifying cells make up on average 60\% of the melanopsin-expressing cells. About half of the melanopsin-expressing cells (or 80\% of the outer stratifying cells) have their soma displaced to the inner nuclear layer. Inner stratifying cells have their soma exclusively in the ganglion cell layer and include a small proportion of bistratified cells. The dendritic field diameter of melanopsin-expressing cells ranges from 250 (near the fovea) to 1,000\,\textmu m in peripheral retina. The dendritic trees of outer stratifying cells cover the retina independent of soma location. The dendritic fields of both outer and inner stratifying cells show a high degree of overlap with a coverage factor of approximately two. Melanopsin-expressing cells occur at an average peak density of between {$\sim$}20 and {$\sim$}40 cells/mm2 at about 2\,mm eccentricity, the density drops to below {$\sim$}10 cells/mm2 at about 8\,mm eccentricity. Both the outer and inner stratifying dendrites express postsynaptic density (PSD95) immunoreactive puncta suggesting that they receive synaptic input from bipolar cells.},

  abstract = {Saint Rocco Museum, a historical building in Venice, Italy is used as a case study to explore the performance of its' lighting system and visible light impact on viewing the large size art works. The transition from threedimensional architectural rendering to the three-dimensional virtual luminance mapping and visualization within a virtual environment is described as an integrated optical method for its application toward preservation of the cultural heritage of the space. Lighting simulation programs represent color as RGB triplets in a devicedependent color space such as ITU-R BT709. Prerequisite for this is a 3D-model which can be created within this computer aided virtual environment. The onsite measured surface luminance, chromaticity and spectral data were used as input to an established real-time indirect illumination and a physically based algorithms to produce the best approximation for RGB to be used as an input to generate the image of the objects. Conversion of RGB to and from spectra has been a major undertaking in order to match the infinite number of spectra to create the same colors that were defined by RGB in the program. The ability to simulate light intensity, candle power and spectral power distributions provide opportunity to examine the impact of color inter-reflections on historical paintings. VR offers an effective technique to quantify the visible light impact on human visual performance under precisely controlled representation of light spectrum that could be experienced in 3D format in a virtual environment as well as historical visual archives. The system can easily be expanded to include other measurements and stimuli.},

  abstract = {Three types of international recommendations are necessary on CATs (chromatic adaptation transforms). CAT-Type I and CAT-Type II are for general use on chromatic adaptation studies. The former is related to chromatic adaptation theory and the latter to performance on field trial data. In addition, CAT-Type III is necessary for a specific and practical purposes. The need for classifying to CAT-Type I and CAT-Type II is found from a careful inspection of the development process from Nayatani et al. transform to BFD transform, referring to the Ph. D. thesis by Lam (University of Bradford, 1985). The process clearly shows two types of flows on the development of various CATs. One is the flow for deepening the theory of chromatic adaptation (CAT-Type I), and the other is for giving good performance to existing field trial data and also ease of use (CAT-Type II). Additional CAT-Type III is, for example, CAT recommended in CIE TC 8-04 technical report. The CAT is only applicable to compare hardcopy and softcopy images for the specified observing conditions in the report. Still, a difficult problem, determination of corresponding colors, remains in the method of subjective estimation, which is useful and widely used for estimating chromatic adaptation effects experimentally. \textcopyright{} 2006 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$>$}Introduction As the response to the COVID-19 pandemic has become increasingly politicized in the United States (US), political party affiliation of state leaders may contribute to policies affecting the spread of the disease. We examined differences in COVID-19 infection and death rates stratified by governor party affiliation across the 50 US states and the District of Columbia (DC). Methods We conducted a longitudinal analysis examining daily COVID-19 incidence and death rates from March 1 through September 30, 2020, for each US state and DC. We fit a Bayesian negative binomial model to estimate adjusted daily risk ratios (RRs) and posterior intervals (PIs) comparing infection and death rates by gubernatorial (mayoral for DC) party affiliation. We adjusted for several state-level variables, including population density, age, race, poverty, and health. Results From March to early June 2020, Republican-led states had, on average, lower COVID-19 incidence rates compared to Democratic-led states. However, on June 8, the association reversed, and Republican-led states had higher per capita COVID-19 incidence rates (RR=1.15, 95\% PI: 1.02, 1.25). This trend persisted until September 30 (RR=1.26, 95\% PI: 0.96, 1.51). For death rates, Republican-led states had lower average rates early in the pandemic, but higher rates from July 13 (RR=1.22, 95\% PI: 1.03,1.37) through September 30 (RR=1.74, 95\% PI: 1.20, 2.24). Conclusion Gubernatorial party affiliation may drive policy decisions that impact COVID-19 infections and deaths across the US. As attitudes toward the pandemic become increasingly polarized, policy decisions should be guided by public health considerations rather than political ideology.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {This paper explores the tilt illusion effect in the Cafe Wall pattern using a classical Gaussian Receptive Field model. In this illusion, the mortar lines are misperceived as diverging or converging rather than horizontal. We examine the capability of a simple bioplausible filtering model to recognize different degrees of tilt effect in the Cafe Wall illusion based on different characteristics of the pattern. Our study employed a Difference of Gaussians model of retinal to cortical ON center and/or OFF center receptive fields. A wide range of parameters of the stimulus, for example mortar thickness, luminance, tiles contrast, phase of the tile displacement, have been studied. Our model constructs an edge map representation at multiple scales that reveals tilt cues and clues involved in the illusory perception of the Cafe Wall pattern. We present here that our model can not only detect the tilt in this pattern, but also can predict the strength of the illusion and quantify the degree of tilt. For the first time quantitative predictions of a model are reported for this stimulus. The results of our simulations are consistent with previous psychophysical findings across the full range of Cafe Wall variations tested. Our results also suggest that the Difference of Gaussians mechanism is the heart of the effects explained by, and the mechanisms proposed for, the Irradiation, Brightness Induction, and Bandpass Filtering models.},

  abstract = {We examined visual short term memory (VSTM) for colour using a delayed-match-to-sample paradigm. In these experiments we measured the effects of increasing inter-stimulus interval (ISI), varying between 0 and 10 s, on the ability of five colour normal human observers to make colour matches between a reference and subsequently presented test stimuli. The coloured stimuli used were defined by different chromatic axes on the isoluminant plane of DKL colour space. In preliminary experiments we used a hue scaling procedure to identify a total of 12 colour stimuli which served as reference hues in the colour memory experiments: four stimuli were exemplars of red, green, blue and yellow colour appearance categories, four were located between these categories and a further four were located on the cardinal axes that isolated the activity of the cone-opponent mechanisms. Our results demonstrate that there is a reduction in the ability of observers to make accurate colour matches with increasing ISIs and that this reduced performance was similar for all colour stimuli. However, the shifts in hue that were measured between the reference and matched test stimuli were significantly greater for the cardinal stimuli compared to those measured for the stimuli defined by the hue scaling procedure. This deterioration in the retention of hue in VSTM for stimuli that isolate cone-opponent mechanisms may be a reflection of the reorganisation of colour processing that occurs in the cortex where colour appearance mechanisms become more prominent.},

  abstract = {The aim of this thesis was to investigate how visual information is organised in perceptual short term memory, with special interest in colour, spatial frequency and velocity. Previous studies of VSTM have indicated the existence of specific memory mechanisms for visual attributes such as orientation, spatial frequency, velocity, contrast and colour. The retention of information in visual short term memory for these basic visual attributes can be disrupted by the presentation of masking stimuli during inter-stimulus intervals (ISIs), which are outside the range of traditional sensory masking. We exploited this memory masking effect in order to examine the organisation of visual information in VSTM. Four groups of experiments were conducted in which participants carried out a delayed discrimination paradigm that employed a two-alternative forced choice (2-AFC) procedure in conjunction with a method of constant stimuli. The fidelity of VSTM was measured by performance markers such as discrimination thresholds and point of subjective equalities. We have found selective memory masking effects, which serve as further evidence in favour of the modular organisation in VSTM, namely, that human visual perceptual memory is based upon multiple, tuned channels in case of colour, spatial frequency and speed, similar to those found in the earliest stages of visual processing for spatial frequency. Moreover, each of these storage mechanisms are tuned to a relatively narrow range of stimulus parameters that are closely linked to visual discrimination mechanisms. These findings add further support to the view that low-level sensory processing mechanisms form the basis for the retention of colour, spatial frequency and velocity information in perceptual memory. We also found evidence for the broad range of transfer of memory masking effects across spatial location, which indicates more long range, long duration interactions between channels that are likely to rely upon contributions from neural processes located in higher visual areas. In conclusion, the experiments presented in this thesis provide significant insight into the organization of visual information in perceptual short term memory.},

Such a difference would be of interest because successive matching is common in everyday life whereas simultaneous matching is standard colorimetric practice. An experiment was performed in which 25 test colors were matched by both methods. The successive or memory method yielded (1) the higher variability of replicative matchings, (2) the shorter matching times, (3) systematically higher purities, and (4) somewhat higher luminances. Three supplementary experiments are cited which are confirmatory with respect to the principal finding of extra purity and luminance usually required for the memory matches. This increased apparent strength of the remembered colors seems to be a direct consequence of the selectivity of memory.},

We have now studied the response properties of neurons in primary visual cortex of awake mice that were allowed to run on a freely rotating spherical treadmill with their heads fixed. Most neurons showed more than a doubling of visually evoked firing rate as the animal transitioned from standing still to running, without changes in spontaneous firing or stimulus selectivity. Tuning properties in the awake animal were similar to those~measured previously in anesthetized animals. Response magnitude in the lateral geniculate nucleus did not increase with locomotion, demonstrating that the striking change in responsiveness did not result from peripheral effects at the eye. Interestingly, some narrow-spiking cells were spontaneously active during running but suppressed by visual stimuli. These results demonstrate powerful cell-type-specific modulation of visual processing by behavioral state in awake mice.},

  abstract = {Color is a key feature of natural environments that higher mammals routinely use to detect food, avoid predators, and interpret social signals. The distribution of color signals in natural scenes is widely variable, ranging from uniform patches to highly nonuniform regions in which different colors lie in close proximity. Whether individual neurons are tuned to this high degree of variability of color signals is unknown. Here, we identified a distinct population of cells in macaque visual cortex (area V4) that have a heterogeneous receptive field (RF) structure in which individual subfields are tuned to different colors even though the full RF is only weakly tuned. This spatial heterogeneity in color tuning indicates a higher degree of complexity of color-encoding mechanisms in visual cortex than previously believed to efficiently extract chromatic information from the environment. Diverse color tuning in V4 receptive fields points to its possible role in encoding complex color stimuli in natural environment.

  abstract = {Cone cells constitute only 3\% of the photoreceptors of the wild-type (WT) mouse. While mouse rods have been thoroughly investigated with suction pipette recordings of their outer segment membrane currents, to date no recordings from WT cones have been published, likely because of the rarity of cones and the fragility of their outer segments. Recently, we characterized the photoreceptors of Nrl-/- mice, using suction pipette recordings from their ``inner segments'' (perinuclear region), and found them to be cones. Here we report the use of this same method to record for the first time the responses of single cones of WT mice, and of mice lacking the {$\alpha$}-subunit of the G-protein transducin (Gt{$\alpha-$}/-), a loss that renders them functionally rodless. Most cones were found to functionally co-express both S- ({$\lambda$}max = 360 nm) and M- ({$\lambda$}max = 508 nm) cone opsins and to be maximally sensitive at 360 nm (``S-cones''); nonetheless, all cones from the dorsal retina were found to be maximally sensitive at 508 nm (``M-cones''). The dim-flash response kinetics and absolute sensitivity of S- and M-cones were very similar and not dependent on which of the coexpressed cone opsins drove transduction; the time to peak of the dim-flash response was {$\sim$}70 ms, and {$\sim$}0.2\% of the circulating current was suppressed per photoisomerization. Amplification in WT cones (A {$\sim$}4 s-2) was found to be about twofold lower than in rods (A {$\sim$}8 s-2). Mouse M-cones maintained their circulating current at very nearly the dark adapted level even when {$>$}90\% of their M-opsin was bleached. S-cones were less tolerant to bleached S-opsin than M-cones to bleached M-opsin, but still far more tolerant than mouse rods to bleached rhodopsin, which exhibit persistent suppression of nearly 50\% of their circulating current following a 20\% bleach. Thus, the three types of mouse opsin appear distinctive in the degree to which their bleached, unregenerated opsins generate ``dark light.''},

Observers were 4 25\textendash 43 yr old males including the 1st author. Small shifts were revealed in the remembered hue produced by certain wavelengths at some delays. These shifts did not follow trends consistent with a storage dependent on sensory pathway characteristics, perceptually unique hues, or semantic encoding but may reflect entropic effects in a storage that is remarkably unbiased. By indicating the discriminability of hues in memory, standard deviations of the delayed matches revealed other characteristics of what is stored: Their smooth, exponential growth questions the existence of "levels" and permits estimating the half-life of hue memory; their continued resemblance to the discrimination function for simultaneously perceived hues suggests that the stored activity closely resembled the sensory response of color. Results also indicate how successive comparisons may be corrected in applied color work. (67 ref) (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

  abstract = {Quantifying and comparing light environments are crucial for interior lighting, architecture and visual ergonomics. Yet, current methods only catch a small subset of the parameters that constitute a light environment, and rarely account for the light that reaches the eye. Here, we describe a new method, the environmental light field (ELF) method, which quantifies all essential features that characterize a light environment, including important aspects that have previously been overlooked. The ELF method uses a calibrated digital image sensor with wide-angle optics to record the radiances that would reach the eyes of people in the environment. As a function of elevation angle, it quantifies the absolute photon flux, its spectral composition in red\textendash green\textendash blue resolution as well as its variation (contrast-span). Together these values provide a complete description of the factors that characterize a light environment. The ELF method thus offers a powerful and convenient tool for the assessment and comparison of light environments. We also present a graphic standard for easy comparison of light environments, and show that different natural and artificial environments have characteristic distributions of light.},

  abstract = {Means and standard deviations of psychophysical measurements are first and second statistical moments that reflect neural mechanisms underlying the measured sensation: for example, standard deviations of hue matches are difference-thresholds that reflect the color pathways' spectral response. Might memory psychophysics yield similar insight into neural mechanisms underlying recognition? Five experiments measured memory means and difference-thresholds: Means of monochromatic hue matches made from memory hardly changed with memory time. Hue memory remained consistent even though the variability of those matches increased exponentially as memory time increased to 14 s. This indicates the loss of accuracy in the memory resulted from a random decay of the stored information. Nevertheless, the hue memory difference-thresholds as a function of wavelength continued to resemble sensory difference-threshold functions as memory time increased. Similar results obtained by dichoptic matches indicated this resemblance was not a retinal effect. Line and grating orientation memory difference-thresholds also retained their similarity to sensory difference-threshold functions as memory time increased. The similarity was not some artifact of measuring difference-thresholds by matching because such results were also obtained using a forced-choice method. Similarity of memory discrimination functions to sensory functions is quantitative evidence that, despite decay, activity retrieved from memory resembles the sensory responses used when two stimuli are compared simultaneously. Feasibility of this conclusion was tested by modeling the memory-matching procedure. It produced difference-thresholds resembling those obtained with simultaneous matches when the stored signal had decayed to 10\%. Together these results provide ``inside'' evidence that cortical activity resembling sensory responses underlie recognition.},

Subjects performed a serial reaction time task comprised of a repeating 10-trial stimulus sequence. When this task was given under dual-task conditions, acquisition of the sequence as assessed by verbal reports and performance measures was minimal. Patients with Korsakoff's syndrome learned the sequence despite their lack of awareness of the repeating pattern.

Using a series of examples, I make the case that behavior is often more useful than neuroscientific measurements for answering the first question. Moreover, I show that even for ``how'' questions that pertain to neural mechanism, a well-crafted behavioral paradigm can offer deeper insight and stronger constraints on computational and mechanistic models than do many highly challenging (and very expensive) neural studies. I conclude that behavioral, rather than neuroscientific research, is essential for understanding the brain, contrary to the opinion of prominent funding bodies and scientific journals, who erroneously place neural data on a pedestal and consider behavior to be subsidiary.},

The eye unconsciously exercises a selective process among the constituent features of a view and thus gives an impressions of enjoyment. Thus, for example, the apparent enlargement of the setting sun is due to a reduction of the field of vision, and the dwarfing of mountainous scenery upon near approach is related to an unconscious enlargement of the field.},

  abstract = {Summary The illumination of a scene strongly affects our perception of~objects in that scene, e.g., the pages of a book illuminated by candlelight will appear quite yellow relative to other types of artificial illuminants. Yet at the same time, the reader still judges the pages as white, their surface color unaffected by~the interplay of paper and illuminant. It has been shown empirically [1] that we can indeed report two quite different interpretations of ``color'': one is dependent on the constant surface spectral reflectance of an object (surface color) and the other on the power of light of different wavelengths reflected from that object (reflected color). How then are these two representations related? The common view, dating from Aristotle, is that our experience of surface color is derived from reflected color or, in more familiar terms, that color perception follows from color sensation [2\textendash 4]. By definition, color constancy requires that vision ``discounts the illuminant''; thus, it seems reasonable that vision begins with the color of objects as they naively appear and that we infer from their appearances their surface color. Here, we question this classic view. We use metacontrast-masked priming and, by presenting the unseen prime and the visible mask under different illuminants, dissociate two ways in which the prime matched the mask: in surface color or in reflected color. We find that priming of the mask occurs when it~matches the prime in surface color, not reflected color. It follows that color perception can arise without prior color sensation.},

I successively consider and reject all motivations that have been provided for this opinion; namely the linguistic (unique hues as referents of necessary and sufficient color descriptors), ``phenomenological'' (unique hues as phenomenologically pure color experiences), and some minor or historical motivations. I conclude that, contrary to the standard opinion, there is no solid reason to claim that the RYGB hues are unique among colors in a sense that would allow for direct neurophysiological explanation. The notion also has no relevance for the construction of perceptual color spaces and is not defensible as an explanatory principle with respect to the existing crosslinguistic patterns of color categorization.},

  abstract = {Apparent window size contradictions arise when optimizing simultaneously for low energy (small sizes) and visual comfort (large sizes). Diverse multi-objective optimization methods exist, but basic questions must be solved beforehand such as choosing appropriate evaluation measures. This work aims to determine the suitability of combined optimization criteria on window sizing procedures for low energy consumption with high visual comfort and performance. The paper showcases diverse measures available to valorise energy consumption and visual aspects. A series of energy and visual criteria were selected, defining acceptance thresholds for dynamic evaluations. Whole-building computer simulations were performed on a standardized office located in a temperate climate. Discrete window-to-wall ratio variations were studied to demonstrate how these criteria affect the solution space. Results were classified using a graphical optimization method, obtaining a solution space satisfying both energy and visual requirements. Most project expectations can be met within the range of sizes. However, unprotected windows barely meet acceptance criteria, needing additional control devices. Applying various related criteria with adequate values increases the diversity of acceptable solutions but too many limits it. Clear objectives and acceptance ranges have to be conceptualized in order to translate them into decisions. This becomes important when involving team design.},

Twenty participants evaluated hue and warm-cool feelings for 48 test lighting settings, by observing an empty gray booth. The results showed that yellow-blue and `warm-cool' feelings are closely located around the Planckian locus, while red-green roughly follows the line orthogonal to the Planckian locus in CIE u'v0 color space, at both 3500 K and 5000 K settings. This suggests that u'v0 color space correlates better with human perception.},

However, targeting these deep brain structures for electrophysiology still remains a challenging task. Here, we propose a novel framework for MRIstereotactic registration and chamber placement for precise electrode guidance to recording sites defined in MRI space. The proposed ``floating frame'' approach can be used without usage of ear bars, greatly reducing pain and discomfort common in standard stereotactic surgeries. Custom pre-surgery planning software was developed to automatically solve the registration problem and report the set of parameters needed to position a stereotactic manipulator to reach a recording site along arbitrary, non-vertical trajectories. Furthermore, the software can automatically identify blood vessels and assist in finding safe trajectories to targets. Our approach was validated by targeting different regions in macaque monkeys and rats. We expect that our method will facilitate recording in new brain areas and provide a valuable tool for electrophysiologists.},

  abstract = {The performance of Light Emitting Diodes (LEDs), including efficiency, flux level, lifetime, and the variation of color, is advancing at a remarkable pace. LEDs are increasingly used for many applications including automotive, aviation, display, transportation and special lighting applications. White LEDs are expected for general lighting applications (solid state lighting) in the near future. Thus, accurate measurements of LEDs and appropriate standards are increasingly important.  This paper reviews photometric, radiometric, and colorimetric quantities used for LEDs, and discusses the current state of optical measurements of LEDs and standardization efforts in International Commission on Illumination (CIE). The paper also touches on the issue of color quality (e.g., Color Rendering Index) of light expected from solid state lighting, and the need for a new metric. The calibration facilities and services for LEDs established at NIST are also discussed.},

To examine the roles that complex cells play in stereopsis, we have recorded extracellularly from isolated single neurons in the striate cortex of anesthetized paralyzed cats. We measured binocular responses of complex cells using a comprehensive stimulus set that encompasses all possible combinations of positions over the receptive fields for the two eyes. For a given position combination, stimulus contrast could be the same for the two eyes (2 bright or 2 dark bars) or opposite (1 bright and 1 dark). These measurements provide a binocular receptive field (RF) profile that completely characterizes complex cell responses in a joint domain of left and right stimulus positions. Complex cells typically exhibit a strong selectivity for binocular disparity, but are only broadly selective for stimulus position. For most cells, selectivity for disparity is more than twice as narrow as that for position. These characteristics are highly desirable if we assume that a disparity sensor should exhibit position invariance while encoding small changes in stimulus depth. Complex cells have nearly identical binocular RFs for bright and dark stimuli as long as the sign of stimulus contrast is the same for the two eyes. When stimulus contrast is opposite, the binocular RF also is inverted such that excitatory subregions become suppressive. We have developed a disparity energy model that accounts for the behavior of disparity-sensitive complex cells. This is a hierarchical model that incorporates specific constraints on the selection of simple cells from which a complex cell receives input. Experimental data are used to examine quantitatively predictions of the model. Responses of complex cells generally agree well with predictions of the disparity energy model. However, various types of deviations from the predictions also are found, including a highly elongated excitatory region beyond that supported by a single energy mechanism. Complex cells in the visual cortex appear to provide a next level of abstraction in encoding information for stereopsis based on the activity of a group of simple-type subunits. In addition to exhibiting narrow disparity tuning and position invariance, these cells seem to provide a partial solution to the stereo correspondence problem that arises in complex natural scenes. Based on their binocular response properties, these cells provide a substantial reduction in the complexity of the correspondence problem.},

  abstract = {Despite the global and local daylight changes naturally occurring in natural scenes, the human visual system usually adapts quite well to those changes, developing a stable color perception. Nevertheless, the influence of daylight in modeling natural image statistics is not fully understood and has received little attention. The aim of this work was to analyze the influence of daylight changes in different high-order chromatic descriptors (i.e., color volume, color gamut, and number of discernible colors) derived from 350 color images, which were rendered under 108 natural illuminants with Correlated Color Temperatures (CCT) from 2735 to 25,889~K. Results suggest that chromatic and luminance information is almost constant and does not depend on the CCT of the illuminant for values above 14,000~K. Nevertheless, differences between the red-green and blue-yellow image components were found below that CCT, with most of the statistical descriptors analyzed showing local extremes in the range 2950~K\textendash 6300~K. Uniform regions and areas of the images attracting observers' attention were also considered in this analysis and were characterized by their patchiness index and their saliency maps. Meanwhile, the results of the patchiness index do not show a clear dependence on CCT, and it is remarkable that a significant reduction in the number of discernible colors (58\% on average) was found when the images were masked with their corresponding saliency maps. Our results suggest that chromatic diversity, as defined in terms of the discernible colors, can be strongly reduced when an observer scans a natural scene. These findings support the idea that a reduction in the number of discernible colors will guide visual saliency and attention. Whatever the modeling is mediating the neural representation of natural images, natural image statistics, it is clear that natural image statistics should take into account those local maxima and minima depending on the daylight illumination and the reduction of the number of discernible colors when salient regions are considered.},

Nevertheless, perceptual and memory processes in the color domain are generally studied in separate research programs with the assumption that they are independent. Here, we demonstrate a strong failure of independence between color perception and memory: the effect of context on color appearance is substantially weakened by a short retention interval between a reference and test stimulus. This somewhat counterintuitive result is consistent with Bayesian estimation: as the precision of the representation of the reference surface and its context decays in memory, prior information gains more weight, causing the retained percepts to be drawn toward prior information about surface and context color. This interaction implies that to fully understand information processing in real-world color tasks, perception and memory need to be considered jointly.},

Previously, we have shown that these receptive field properties may be accounted for in terms of a strategy for producing a sparse distribution of output activity in response to natural images. Here, in addition to describing this work in a more expansive fashion, we examine the neurobiological implications of sparse coding. Of particular interest is the case when the code is overcomplete\textemdash i.e., when the number of code elements is greater than the effective dimensionality of the input space. Because the basis functions are non-orthogonal and not linearly independent of each other, sparsifying the code will recruit only those basis functions necessary for representing a given input, and so the input-output function will deviate from being purely linear. These deviations from linearity provide a potential explanation for the weak forms of non-linearity observed in the response properties of cortical simple cells, and they further make predictions about the expected interactions among units in response to naturalistic stimuli.},

Vis.6, 996 (2006)] instead varied purity by using Gaussian spectra and increasing their bandwidth. Under these conditions the hues of lights at short and medium wavelengths tended to remain constant and thus were tied to a fixed property of the stimulus such as the spectral peak, possibly reflecting a compensation for the spectral filtering effects of the eye. Here we test this account more completely by comparing constant hue loci across a wide range of wavelengths and between the fovea and periphery. Purity was varied by adding either a fixed spectrum or by varying the spectral bandwidth, using an Agile Light Source capable of generating arbitrary spectra. For both types of spectra, hue loci were approximated by the Gaussian model at short and medium wavelengths, though the model failed to predict the precise form of the hue changes or the differences between the fovea and periphery. Our results suggest that a Gaussian model provides a useful heuristic for predicting constant hue loci and the form of the Abney effect at short and medium wavelengths and may approximate the inferences underlying the representation of hue in the visual system.},

  abstract = {Extant research has shown that previously acquired categorical knowledge affects recognition memory, and that differences in category learning strategies impact classification accuracy. However, it is unknown whether different learning strategies also have downstream effects on subsequent recognition memory. The present study investigates the effect of two unidimensional rule-based category learning strategies \textendash{} learning (a) with or without explicit instruction, and (b) with or without supervision \textendash{} on subsequent recognition memory. Our findings suggest that acquiring categorical knowledge increased both hits (Experiments 1 and 2) and false-alarms (Experiment 1) for category-congruent items regardless of the particular strategy employed in initially learning these categories. There were, however, small processing speed advantages during recognition memory for both explicit instruction and supervised practice relative to neither (Experiment 2). We discuss these findings in the context of how prior knowledge influences recognition memory, and in relation to similar findings showing schematic effects on episodic memory.},

  abstract = {This review outlines how eyes of terrestrial vertebrates and insects meet the competing requirements of coding both spatial and spectral information. There is no unique solution to this problem. Thus, mammals and honeybees use their long-wavelength receptors for both achromatic (luminance) and colour vision, whereas flies and birds probably use separate sets of photoreceptors for the two purposes. In particular, we look at spectral tuning and diversification among `long-wavelength' receptors (sensitivity maxima at greater than 500 nm), which play a primary role in luminance vision. Data on spectral sensitivities and phylogeny of visual photopigments can be incorporated into theoretical models to suggest how eyes are adapted to coding natural stimuli. Models indicate, for example, that animal colour vision\textemdash involving five or fewer broadly tuned receptors\textemdash is well matched to most natural spectra. We can also predict that the particular objects of interest and signal-to-noise ratios will affect the optimal eye design. Nonetheless, it remains difficult to account for the adaptive significance of features such as co-expression of photopigments in single receptors, variation in spectral sensitivities of mammalian L-cone pigments and the diversification of long-wavelength receptors that has occurred in several terrestrial lineages.},

Some researchers argue that color categories are linguistically constructed, while others claim they have a pre-linguistic, and possibly even innate, basis. Although there is some evidence that 4\textendash 6-month-old infants respond categorically to color, these empirical results have been challenged in recent years. First, it has been claimed that previous demonstrations of color categories in infants may reflect color preferences instead. Second, and more seriously, other labs have reported failing to replicate the basic findings at all. In the current study we used eye-tracking to test 8-month-old infants' categorical perception of a previously attested color boundary (green\textendash blue) and an additional color boundary (blue\textendash purple). Our results show that infants are faster and more accurate at fixating targets when they come from a different color category than when from the same category (even though the chromatic separation sizes were equated). This is the case for both blue\textendash green and blue\textendash purple. Our findings provide independent evidence for the existence of color categories in pre-linguistic infants, and suggest that categorical perception of color can occur without color language.},

The system requires the user to place the tip of his/her index finger on the lens of a smart phone camera, while the flash is on. The captured video signal often contains noise generated due to (i) improper finger placement, (ii) imparting excessive pressure, which subsequently blocks normal blood circulation and (iii) movement of the fingertip. To mitigate the above issues, a two stage approach has been proposed. Firstly, the onset of good video signal is detected by formulating a finite state machine, which employs multiple window short time fast fourier transform. Only upon receiving sufficient acceptable video signal, the heart rate is computed. Results indicate that the proposed method has successfully identified and rejected noisy video signal, resulting in avoidance of erroneous output.},

  abstract = {In mammals, a small population of intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells (ipRGCs) plays a key role in the regulation of nonvisual photic responses, such as behavioral responses to light, pineal melatonin synthesis, pupillary light reflex, and sleep latency. These ipRGCs also express melanopsin (Opn4), a putative opsin-family photopigment that has been shown to play a role in mediating these nonvisual photic responses. Melanopsin is required for the function of this inner retinal pathway, but its precise role in generating photic responses has not yet been determined. We found that expression of melanopsin in Xenopus oocytes results in light-dependent activation of membrane currents through the G{$\alpha$}q/G{$\alpha$}11 G protein pathway, with an action spectrum closely matching that of melanopsin-expressing ipRGCs and of behavioral responses to light in mice lacking rods and cones. When coexpressed with arrestins, melanopsin could use all-trans-retinaldehyde as a chromophore, which suggests that it may function as a bireactive opsin. We also found that melanopsin could activate the cation channel TRPC3, a mammalian homolog of the Drosophila phototransduction channels TRP and TRPL. Melanopsin therefore signals more like an invertebrate opsin than like a classical vertebrate rod-and-cone opsin. In mammals, the opsin that detects light for circadian rhythms and pupil constriction activates signaling pathways that are similar to those used in invertebrates for vision. In mammals, the opsin that detects light for circadian rhythms and pupil constriction activates signaling pathways that are similar to those used in invertebrates for vision.},

  abstract = {Working memory is critical to cognition, decoupling behavior from the immediate world. Yet, it is imperfect; internal noise introduces errors into memory representations. Such errors have been shown to accumulate over time and increase with the number of items simultaneously held in working memory. Here, we show that discrete attractor dynamics mitigate the impact of noise on working memory. These dynamics pull memories towards a few stable representations in mnemonic space, inducing a bias in memory representations but reducing the effect of random diffusion. Model-based and model-free analyses of human and monkey behavior show that discrete attractor dynamics account for the distribution, bias, and precision of working memory reports. Furthermore, attractor dynamics are adaptive. They increase in strength as noise increases with memory load and experiments in humans show these dynamics adapt to the statistics of the environment, such that memories drift towards contextually-predicted values. Together, our results suggest attractor dynamics mitigate errors in working memory by counteracting noise and integrating contextual information into memories.},

A similar `selection' mechanism is thought to control the representations held `in mind'\textemdash in working memory5\textendash 10. Here we show that shared neural mechanisms underlie the selection of items from working memory and attention to sensory stimuli. We trained rhesus monkeys to switch between two tasks, either selecting one item from a set of items held in working memory or attending to one stimulus from a set of visual stimuli. Neural recordings showed that similar representations in prefrontal cortex encoded the control of both selection and attention, suggesting that prefrontal cortex acts as a domain-general controller. By contrast, both attention and selection were represented independently in parietal and visual cortex. Both selection and attention facilitated behaviour by enhancing and transforming the representation of the selected memory or attended stimulus. Specifically, during the selection task, memory items were initially represented in independent subspaces of neural activity in prefrontal cortex. Selecting an item caused its representation to transform from its own subspace to a new subspace used to guide behaviour. A similar transformation occurred for attention. Our results suggest that prefrontal cortex controls cognition by dynamically transforming representations to control what and when cognitive computations are engaged.},

By uniform sampling of this, we collected 84 color signals from each color samples and combined them to form a training dataset. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) has been applied on the selected training dataset to find the basis vectors and the number of color signals needed for estimation. We apply the Wiener estimation with different order of polynomials to estimate the color signal of color samples. Interestingly, good estimation of all 1645 color signals of given color sample from Macbeth color chart is obtained by selecting five best CCT color signals of that given color sample and with association to its third order polynomial. However, the results from high order polynomials yield to significant errors on Wiener estimation.},

The purpose was 3-fold: to examine (1) CIELAB coordinates of centroids for 12 Russian basic color terms (BCTs), including 2 Russian terms for ``blue'', sinij ``dark blue'', and goluboj ``light blue'', and compare these with coordinates for the 11 English BCTs obtained in earlier studies; (2) frequent nonBCTs; and (3) gender differences in color naming. Native Russian speakers participated in the experiment using an unconstrained color-naming method. Each participant named 20 colors, selected from 600 colors densely sampling the Munsell Color Solid. Color names and response times of typing onset were registered. Several deviations between centroids of the Russian and English BCTs were found. The 2 ``Russian blues'', as expected, divided the BLUE area along the lightness dimension; their centroids deviated from a centroid of English blue. Further minor departures were found between centroids of Russian and English counterparts of ``brown'' and ``red''. The Russian color inventory confirmed the linguistic refinement of the PURPLE area, with high frequencies of nonBCTs. In addition, Russian speakers revealed elaborated naming strategies and use of a rich inventory of nonBCTs. Elicitation frequencies of the 12 BCTs were comparable for both genders; however, linguistic segmentation of color space, employing a synthetic observer, revealed gender differences in naming colors, with more refined naming of the ``warm'' colors from females. We conclude that, along with universal perceptual factors, that govern categorical partition of color space, Russian speakers' color naming reflects language-specific factors, supporting the weak relativity hypothesis.},

  abstract = {The segmentation of visible electromagnetic radiation into chromatic categories by the human visual system has been extensively studied from a perceptual point of view, resulting in several colour appearance models. However, there is currently a void when it comes to relate these results to the physiological mechanisms that are known to shape the pre-cortical and cortical visual pathway. This work intends to begin to fill this void by proposing a new physiologically plausible model of colour categorization based on Neural Isoresponsive Colour Ellipsoids (NICE) in the cone-contrast space defined by the main directions of the visual signals entering the visual cortex. The model was adjusted to fit psychophysical measures that concentrate on the categorical boundaries and are consistent with the ellipsoidal isoresponse surfaces of visual cortical neurons. By revealing the shape of such categorical colour regions, our measures allow for a more precise and parsimonious description, connecting well-known early visual processing mechanisms to the less understood phenomenon of colour categorization. To test the feasibility of our method we applied it to exemplary images and a popular ground-truth chart obtaining labelling results that are better than those of current state-of-the-art algorithms.},

  abstract = {The asymmetric dominance effect or decoy effect emerges when a third inferior option is introduced to a choice set. The decoy option, although typically not chosen, impacts relative preference for the original two options. This decisional bias stands in contrast with rational choice theory, which dictates that choice behavior should remain consistent for the original options with the addition of different alternatives to a choice set such as the decoy. In the current study, we assessed the decoy effect in rhesus monkeys using a computerized task battery that introduced two different computerized tasks, including a matching-to-sample task and a psychomotor task called PURSUIT. Decoy tasks were designed such that they were inferior versions of these original task options, requiring longer time to completion (via slowed cursor speeds) and subsequently reduced reinforcement rates. Monkeys learned to associate unique icons for each task (including for decoy tasks), and used these icons to select their preferred task from a choice set of two to three task options. Monkeys learned to perform all tasks, but did not show evidence of the decoy effect using this task preference paradigm. We discuss the role of initial task preference (and task biases), task type (symbolic vs. perceptual), and decoy effect sizes in light of these findings. We contrast the current results to previous findings of the decoy effect in rhesus monkeys using a perceptual paradigm as well as to other evidence of the decoy effect in non-primate animal species.},

While these animals are capable of discriminating color and polarization, it is unknown what specific attributes of a visual object are important during recognition. Here we show that mantis shrimp of the species Neogonodactylus oerstedii are able to learn the shape of a trained target (p=0.048). Further, when the shape and color of a target which they had been trained to identify were placed in conflict, N. oerstedii tended to choose the target of the trained shape over the target of the trained color (p=0.054). Thus, we conclude that the shape of the target was more salient than its color during recognition by N. oerstedii, suggesting that the shapes of objects, such as landmarks or other animals, are important for their identification by the species.},

The receptive fields of midget ganglion cells exhibit both spectral and spatial opponency and are implicated in both color and achromatic form vision, yet the exact mechanisms linking their responses to visual perception remain unclear. Efforts to develop color vision models that accurately predict all the features of human color and form vision based on midget ganglion cells provide a case study connecting experimental and theoretical neuroscience, drawing on diverse research areas such as anatomy, physiology, psychophysics, and computer vision. Recent technological advances have allowed researchers to test some predictions of color vision models in new and precise ways, producing results that challenge traditional views. Here, we review the progress in developing models of color-coding receptive fields that are consistent with human psychophysics, the biology of the primate visual system and the response properties of midget retinal ganglion cells.},

Although colour constancy has evolved under a constrained subset of illuminations, it is unknown whether its underlying mechanisms, thought to involve multiple components from retina to cortex, are optimised for particular environmental variations. Here we demonstrate a new method for investigating colour constancy using illumination matching in real scenes which, unlike previous methods using surface matching and simulated scenes, allows testing of multiple, real illuminations. We use real scenes consisting of solid familiar or unfamiliar objects against uniform or variegated backgrounds and compare discrimination performance for typical illuminations from the daylight chromaticity locus (approximately blue-yellow) and atypical spectra from an orthogonal locus (approximately red-green, at correlated colour temperature 6700 K), all produced in real time by a 10-channel LED illuminator. We find that discrimination of illumination changes is poorer along the daylight locus than the atypical locus, and is poorest particularly for bluer illumination changes, demonstrating conversely that surface colour constancy is best for blue daylight illuminations. Illumination discrimination is also enhanced, and therefore colour constancy diminished, for uniform backgrounds, irrespective of the object type. These results are not explained by statistical properties of the scene signal changes at the retinal level. We conclude that high-level mechanisms of colour constancy are biased for the blue daylight illuminations and variegated backgrounds to which the human visual system has typically been exposed.},

  abstract = {Circadian rhythms are endogenous 24 h cycles that persist in the absence of external time cues. These rhythms provide an internal representation of day length and optimize physiology and behaviour to the varying demands of the solar cycle. These clocks require daily adjustment to local time and the primary time cue (zeitgeber) used by most vertebrates is the daily change in the amount of environmental light (irradiance) at dawn and dusk, a process termed photoentrainment. Attempts to understand the photoreceptor mechanisms mediating non-image-forming responses to light, such as photoentrainment, have resulted in the discovery of a remarkable array of different photoreceptors and photopigment families, all of which appear to use a basic opsin/vitamin A-based photopigment biochemistry. In non-mammalian vertebrates, specialized photoreceptors are located within the pineal complex, deep brain and dermal melanophores. There is also strong evidence in fish and amphibians for the direct photic regulation of circadian clocks in multiple tissues. By contrast, mammals possess only ocular photoreceptors. However, in addition to the image-forming rods and cones of the retina, there exists a third photoreceptor system based on a subset of melanopsin-expressing photosensitive retinal ganglion cells (pRGCs). In this review, we discuss the range of vertebrate photoreceptors and their opsin photopigments, describe the melanopsin/pRGC system in some detail and then finally consider the molecular evolution and sensory ecology of these non-image-forming photoreceptor systems.},

This review discusses the signaling pathways that may underlie melanopsin-dependent phototransduction in native pRGCs, as well as the many exciting challenges ahead.},

Even though these methods offer high reliability, they require the users to have special sensor to measure their heart rate. In this paper we propose a system capable of estimating the heart beat rate using just a camera from a commercially available mobile phone. The advantage of this method is that the user does not need specialized hardware and s/he can take a measurement in virtually any place under almost any circumstances. Moreover the measurement provided can be used as a tool for health coaching applications or effective telecare services aimed in enhancing the user's well being.},

These limits, the optimal color stimuli, were computed for a color normal observer and CIE standard illuminant D65, and the resultant colors were expressed in the CIELAB and DIN99d color spaces. The corresponding color volumes for abnormal color vision were computed using models simulating for normal trichromatic observers the appearance for dichromats and anomalous trichomats. The number of colors perceived in each case was then computed from the color volumes enclosed by the optimal colors also known as MacAdam limits. It was estimated that dichromats perceive less than 1\% of the colors perceived by normal trichromats and that anomalous trichromats perceive 50\%\textendash 60\% for anomalies in the medium-wavelength-sensitive and 60\%\textendash 70\% for anomalies in the long-wavelength-sensitive cones. Complementary estimates obtained similarly for the spectral locus of monochromatic stimuli suggest less impairment for color-deficient observers, a fact that is explained by the two-dimensional nature of the locus.},

  abstract = {Psychophysical studies suggest that different colors have different perceptual status: red and blue for example are thought of as elementary sensations whereas yellowish green is not. The dominant account for such perceptual asymmetries attributes them to specificities of the neuronal representation of colors. Alternative accounts involve cultural or linguistic arguments. What these accounts have in common is the idea that there are no asymmetries in the physics of light and surfaces that could underlie the perceptual structure of colors, and this is why neuronal or cultural processes must be invoked as the essential underlying mechanisms that structure color perception. Here, we suggest a biological approach for surface reflection properties that takes into account only the information about light that is accessible to an organism given the photopigments it possesses, and we show that now asymmetries appear in the behavior of surfaces with respect to light. These asymmetries provide a classification of surface properties that turns out to be identical to the one observed in linguistic color categorization across numerous cultures, as pinned down by cross cultural studies. Further, we show that data from psychophysical studies about unique hues and hue cancellation are consistent with the viewpoint that stimuli reported by observers as special are those associated with this singularity-based categorization of surfaces under a standard illuminant. The approach predicts that unique blue and unique yellow should be aligned in chromatic space while unique red and unique green should not, a fact usually conjectured to result from nonlinearities in chromatic pathways.},

The results stressed the importance of the spectral distribution with respect to effective wavelengths in causing colour degradation, and in general white LEDs resulted more suitable, in terms of fading prevention, than traditional halogen light sources.},

  abstract = {Light plays a critical role in the regulation of numerous aspects of physiology and behaviour, including the entrainment of circadian rhythms and the regulation of sleep. These responses involve melanopsin (OPN4)-expressing photosensitive retinal ganglion cells (pRGCs) in addition to rods and cones. Nocturnal light exposure in rodents has been shown to result in rapid sleep induction, in which melanopsin plays a key role. However, studies have also shown that light exposure can result in elevated corticosterone, a response that is not compatible with sleep. To investigate these contradictory findings and to dissect the relative contribution of pRGCs and rods/cones, we assessed the effects of light of different wavelengths on behaviourally defined sleep. Here, we show that blue light (470 nm) causes behavioural arousal, elevating corticosterone and delaying sleep onset. By contrast, green light (530 nm) produces rapid sleep induction. Compared to wildtype mice, these responses are altered in melanopsin-deficient mice (Opn4-/-), resulting in enhanced sleep in response to blue light but delayed sleep induction in response to green or white light. We go on to show that blue light evokes higher Fos induction in the SCN compared to the sleep-promoting ventrolateral preoptic area (VLPO), whereas green light produced greater responses in the VLPO. Collectively, our data demonstrates that nocturnal light exposure can have either an arousal- or sleep-promoting effect, and that these responses are melanopsin-mediated via different neural pathways with different spectral sensitivities. These findings raise important questions relating to how artificial light may alter behaviour in both the work and domestic setting.},

The dependent variables considered were reading time, reading errors and incorrect answers to a comprehension test. The main results demonstrated that these parameters of reading performance are all influenced by the five aforementioned chromatic conditions. These outcomes manifest similar trends in four groups of readers: children and adults combined with normal or dyslexic readers. Possible applied research and clinical applications are discussed together with some basic questions related to color vision suggesting that the main purposes of color for living beings is to generate wholeness, parts-whole organization and perceptual segmentation.},

  abstract = {In this paper the theoretical and practical feasibility of self-calibration in the presence of varying intrinsic camera parameters is under investigation. The paper's main contribution is to propose a self-calibration method which efficiently deals with all kinds of constraints on the intrinsic camera parameters. Within this framework a practical method is proposed which can retrieve metric reconstruction from image sequences obtained with uncalibrated zooming/focusing cameras. The feasibility of the approach is illustrated on real and synthetic examples. Besides this a theoretical proof is given which shows that the absence of skew in the image plane is sufficient to allow for self-calibration. A counting argument is developed which\textemdash depending on the set of constraints\textemdash gives the minimum sequence length for self-calibration and a method to detect critical motion sequences is proposed.},

  abstract = {Background Neuroscience research on non-human primates usually requires the animals to sit in a chair. To do this, typically monkeys are fitted with collars and trained to enter the chairs using either a pole, leash and jump cage. Animals may initially show resistance and risk injury. We have developed an automated chair-training method that minimizes restraints to ease the animals into their chairs. New method We developed a method to automatically train animals to enter a primate chair and stick out their heads for neckplate placement. To do this, we fitted the chairs with Arduino microcontrollers coupled to a water-reward system and touch- and proximity sensors. Results and comparison with existing methods We found that the animals responded well to the chair, partially entering the chair within hours, sitting inside the chair within days and allowing us to manually introduce a door and neck plate, all within 14\textendash 21 sessions. Although each session could last many hours, automation meant that actual training person-hours could be as little as half an hour per day. The biggest advantage was that animals showed little resistance to entering the chair, compared to monkeys trained by leash pulling. Conclusions This automated chair-training method can take longer than the standard collar-and-leash approach, but multiple macaques can be trained in parallel with fewer person-hours. It is also a promising method for animal-use refinement and in our case, it was the only effective training approach for an animal suffering from a behavioral pathology.},

We investigated neuronal selectivity in monkey inferotemporal cortex via the vast hypothesis space of a generative deep neural network, avoiding assumptions about features or semantic categories. A genetic algorithm searched this space for stimuli that maximized neuronal firing. This led to the evolution of rich synthetic images of objects with complex combinations of shapes, colors, and textures, sometimes resembling animals or familiar people, other times revealing novel patterns that did not map to any clear~semantic category. These results expand our conception of the dictionary of features encoded in the cortex, and the approach can potentially reveal the internal representations of any system whose input can be captured by a generative model.},

  abstract = {Visual area V4 is an important midlevel cortical processing stage that subserves object recognition in primates. Studies investigating shape coding in V4 have largely probed neuronal responses with filled shapes, i.e., shapes defined by both a boundary and an interior fill. As a result, we do not know whether form-selective V4 responses are dictated by boundary features alone or if interior fill is also important. We studied 43 V4 neurons in two male macaque monkeys ( Macaca mulatta) with a set of 362 filled shapes and their corresponding outlines to determine how interior fill modulates neuronal responses in shape-selective neurons. Only a minority of neurons exhibited similar response strength and shape preferences for filled and outline stimuli. A majority responded preferentially to one stimulus category (either filled or outline shapes) and poorly to the other. Our findings are inconsistent with predictions of the hierarchical-max (HMax) V4 model that builds form selectivity from oriented boundary features and takes little account of attributes related to object surface, such as the phase of the boundary edge. We modified the V4 HMax model to include sensitivity to interior fill by either removing phase-pooling or introducing unoriented units at the V1 level; both modifications better explained our data without increasing the number of free parameters. Overall, our results suggest that boundary orientation and interior surface information are both maintained until at least the midlevel visual representation, consistent with the idea that object fill is important for recognition and perception in natural vision. NEW \& NOTEWORTHY The shape of an object's boundary is critical for identification; consistent with this idea, models of object recognition predict that filled and outline versions of a shape are encoded similarly. We report that many neurons in a midlevel visual cortical area respond differently to filled and outline shapes and modify a biologically plausible model to account for our data. Our results suggest that representations of boundary shape and surface fill are interrelated in visual cortex.},

  abstract = {Intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells (ipRGCs) exhibit melanopsin-dependent light responses that persist in the absence of rod and cone photoreceptor-mediated input. In addition to signaling anterogradely to the brain, ipRGCs signal retrogradely to intraretinal circuitry via gap junction-mediated electrical synapses with amacrine cells (ACs). However, the targets and functions of these intraretinal signals remain largely unknown. Here, in mice of both sexes, we identify circuitry that enables M5 ipRGCs to locally inhibit retinal neurons via electrical synapses with a non-spiking GABAergic AC. During pharmacological blockade of rod- and cone-mediated input, whole-cell recordings of corticotropin-releasing hormone-expressing (CRH+) ACs reveal persistent visual responses that require both melanopsin expression and gap junctions. In the developing retina, ipRGC-mediated input to CRH+ ACs is weak or absent prior to eye opening, indicating a primary role for this input in the mature retina, i.e., in parallel with rod- and cone-mediated input. Among several ipRGC types, only M5 ipRGCs exhibit consistent anatomical and physiological coupling to CRH+ ACs. Optogenetic stimulation of local CRH+ ACs directly drives inhibitory postsynaptic currents in M4 and M5, but not M1-M3, ipRGCs. CRH+ ACs also inhibit M2 ipRGC-coupled spiking ACs, demonstrating direct interaction between discrete networks of ipRGC-coupled interneurons. Together, these results demonstrate a functional role for electrical synapses in translating ipRGC activity into feedforward and feedback inhibition of local retinal circuits. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Melanopsin directly generates light responses in intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells (ipRGCs). Through gap junction-mediated electrical synapses with retinal interneurons, these uniquely photoreceptive RGCs may also influence the activity and output of neuronal circuits within the retina. Here, we identified and studied an electrical synaptic circuit that, in principle, could couple ipRGC activity to the chemical output of an identified retinal interneuron. Specifically, we found that M5 ipRGCs form electrical synapses with corticotropin-releasing hormone-expressing amacrine cells, which locally release GABA to inhibit specific RGC types. Thus, ipRGCs are poised to influence the output of diverse retinal circuits via electrical synapses with interneurons.},

  abstract = {Colors often appear to differ in arbitrary ways among related species. However, a fraction of color diversity may be explained because some signals are more easily perceived in one environment rather than another. Models show that not only signals but also the perception of signals should regularly evolve in response to different environments, whether these primarily involve detection of conspecifics or detection of predators and prey. Thus, a deeper understanding of how perception of color correlates with environmental attributes should help generate more predictive models of color divergence. Here, I briefly review our understanding of color vision in vertebrates. Then I focus on opsin spectral tuning and opsin expression, two traits involved in color perception that have become amenable to study. I ask how opsin tuning is correlated with ecological differences, notably the light environment, and how this potentially affects perception of conspecific colors. Although opsin tuning appears to evolve slowly, opsin expression levels are more evolutionarily labile but have been difficult to connect to color perception. The challenge going forward will be to identify how physiological differences involved in color vision, such as opsin expression levels, translate into perceptual differences, the selection pressures that have driven those differences, and ultimately how this may drive evolution of conspecific colors.},

  abstract = {This paper relates major functions at the start and end of the color vision process. The process starts with three cone photoreceptors transducing light into electrical responses. Cone sensitivities were once expected to be Red Green Blue color matching functions (to mix colors) but microspectrometry proved otherwise: they instead peak in yellowish, greenish, and blueish hues. These physiological functions are an enigma, unmatched with any set of psychophysical (behavioral) functions. The end-result of the visual process is color sensation, whose essential percepts are unique (or pure) hues red, yellow, green, blue. Unique hues cannot be described by other hues, but can describe all other hues, e.g., that hue is reddish-blue. They are carried by four opponent chromatic response curves but the literature does not specify whether each curve represents a range of hues or only one hue (a unique) over its wavelength range. Here the latter is demonstrated, confirming that opponent chromatic responses define, and may be termed, unique hue chromatic responses. These psychophysical functions also are an enigma, unmatched with any physiological functions or basis. Here both enigmas are solved by demonstrating the three cone sensitivity curves and the three spectral chromatic response curves are almost identical sets (Pearson correlation coefficients r from 0.95\textendash 1.0) in peak wavelengths, curve shapes, math functions, and curve crossover wavelengths, though previously unrecognized due to presentation of curves in different formats, e.g., log, linear. (Red chromatic response curve is largely nonspectral and thus derives from two cones.) Close correlation combined with deterministic causation implies cones are the physiological basis of unique hues. This match of three physiological and three psychophysical functions is unique in color vision.},

This paper concerns the last factor and presents two radiometric and one colorimetric methods of predicting cool\textendash warm balanced illuminants. For a high correlated colour temperature, the spectral power distributions of Planckian and daylight-simulating illuminants are high in short wavelengths and low in long wavelengths and, therefore, appear bluish. The reverse is true for low correlated colour temperature illuminants, which appear yellowish. The balanced spectral power distribution occurs at 5000 K. MacAdam's complementary powers function is psychophysical and represents the power of wavelengths across the visible spectrum required to neutralize (convert to white) their complementaries. Again the balanced power occurs for illuminants of 5000 K. Hence, a correlated colour temperature in the 4500\textendash 5500 K range is recommended for cool\textendash warm balanced illuminants. This recommendation is supported by results of four recent experimental studies.},

  abstract = {Despite decades of research, there is still uncertainty about how people make simple decisions about perceptual stimuli. Most theories assume that perceptual decisions are based on decision variables, which are internal variables that encode task-relevant information. However, decision variables are usually considered to be theoretical constructs that cannot be measured directly, and this often makes it difficult to test theories of perceptual decision making. Here we show how to measure decision variables on individual trials, and we use these measurements to test theories of perceptual decision making more directly than has previously been possible. We measure classification images, which are estimates of templates that observers use to extract information from stimuli. We then calculate the dot product of these classification images with the stimuli to estimate observers' decision variables. Finally, we reconstruct each observer's ``decision space,'' a map that shows the probability of the observer's responses for all values of the decision variables. We use this method to examine decision strategies in two-alternative forced choice (2AFC) tasks, for which there are several competing models. In one experiment, the resulting decision spaces support the difference model, a classic theory of 2AFC decisions. In a second experiment, we find unexpected decision spaces that are not predicted by standard models of 2AFC decisions, and that suggest intrinsic uncertainty or soft thresholding. These experiments give new evidence regarding observers' strategies in 2AFC tasks, and they show how measuring decision variables can answer long-standing questions about perceptual decision making.},

  abstract = {Stroop interference is characterized by strong asymmetry between word and color naming such that the former is faster and interferes with the latter but not vice versa. This asymmetry is attributed to differential experience with naming in the two dimensions, i.e., words and colors. Here we show that training on visual-verbal paired associate tasks equivalent to color and shape naming, not involving word reading, leads to strongly asymmetric interference patterns. In two experiments adults practiced naming colors and shapes, one dimension more extensively (10days) than the other (2days), depending on group assignment. One experiment used novel shapes (ideograms) and the other familiar geometric shapes, associated with nonsense syllables. In a third experiment participants practiced naming either colors or shapes using cross-category shape and color names, respectively, for 12days. Across experiments, despite equal training of the two groups in naming the two different dimensions, color naming was strongly affected by shape even after extensive practice, whereas shape naming was resistant to interference. To reconcile these findings with theoretical accounts of interference, reading may be conceptualized as involving visual-verbal associations akin to shape naming. An inherent or early-developing advantage for naming shapes may provide an evolutionary substrate for the invention and development of reading.},

  abstract = {We have identified an opsin, melanopsin, in photosensitive dermal melanophores of Xenopus laevis. Its deduced amino acid sequence shares greatest homology with cephalopod opsins. The predicted secondary structure of melanopsin indicates the presence of a long cytoplasmic tail with multiple putative phosphorylation sites, suggesting that this opsin's function may be finely regulated. Melanopsin mRNA is expressed in hypothalamic sites thought to contain deep brain photoreceptors and in the iris, a structure known to be directly photosensitive in amphibians. Melanopsin message is also localized in retinal cells residing in the outermost lamina of the inner nuclear layer where horizontal cells are typically found. Its expression in retinal and nonretinal tissues suggests a role in vision and nonvisual photoreceptive tasks, such as photic control of skin pigmentation, pupillary aperture, and circadian and photoperiodic physiology.},

  abstract = {The origins, development, and status of the {$\pi$} mechanism theory are reviewed. The paper is divided into four sections. In the first section Stiles's general ideas about `color mechanisms' are examined, and it is concluded that foremost amongst these is a mathematical theory that specifies certain formal rules or laws that should govern a certain class of observations. In the case of {$\pi$} mechanisms, the class of observations is that of two-color thresholds, and the defining laws are the two well-known displacement laws. Five other laws that two-color increment-threshold observations should obey, if the latter are governed by ideal {$\pi$} mechanisms, are abstracted from Stiles's writings. In the second section literature pertinent to the testing of the seven Stilesian laws is reviewed, and it is asked whether or not the seven {$\pi$} mechanisms of Stiles do in fact obey the laws. In the third section the relation of the {$\pi$} mechanism concept to physiological concepts is examined, and its relation to the `cone fundamental' is discussed; the evidence pertinent to the question: `Are any of the {$\pi$} mechanisms of the single-fundamental type?' is then reviewed. The last section is devoted to the evolution of Stiles's ideas in the period after 1959 when Stiles's own investigations and those of others propelled him to reject the initial (1953) {$\pi$} mechanism theory as an adequate characterization of the data of the two-color threshold.},

We hypothesize that under the conditions that isolate these branches of the two-color threshold a signal originating with the photon absorptions of the short-wavelength cones passes through two sites of attenuation. The first site's gain is controlled by the short-wavelength cones alone; the second site's gain is determined by a net ``blue/yellow'' opponent signal. The two sites are distinguished by spectral sensitivity, absolute field sensitivity and dynamic properties. The theory, formalized in four equations, provides a good account of these features of the increment thresholds: (1) super-additivity of the effects of{$\Pi$}1-equated long- and short-wavelength fields; (2) upward deviation of the{$\Pi$}1 threshold from the Weber line on bright blue backgrounds; (3) cancellative subadditivity of fields whose mixture is in approximate blue/yellow equilibrium: (4) the ``limited conditioning effect'' of long-wavelength fields; (5) transient ``tritanopia''.},

  abstract = {Melanopsin has been proposed to be the photopigment of the intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells (ipRGCs); these photoreceptors of the mammalian eye drive circadian and pupillary adjustments through direct projections to the brain. Their action spectrum ( max 480 nm) implicates an opsin and melanopsin is the only opsin known to exist in these cells. Melanopsin is required for ipRGC photosensitivity and for behavioural photoresponses that survive disrupted rod and cone function. Heterologously expressed melanopsin apparently binds retinaldehyde and mediates photic activation of G proteins. However, its amino-acid sequence differs from vertebrate photosensory opsins and some have suggested that melanopsin may be a photoisomerase, providing retinoid chromophore to an unidentified opsin. To determine whether melanopsin is a functional sensory photopigment, here we transiently expressed it in HEK293 cells that stably expressed TRPC3 channels. Light triggered a membrane depolarization in these cells and increased intracellular calcium. The light response resembled that of ipRGCs, with almost identical spectral sensitivity ( max 479 nm). The phototransduction pathway included Gq or a related G protein, phospholipase C and TRPC3 channels. We conclude that mammalian melanopsin is a functional sensory photopigment, that it is the photopigment of ganglion-cell photoreceptors, and that these photoreceptors may use an invertebrate-like phototransduction cascade.},

Mice, a prominent visual system model, are dichromatic with enhanced sensitivity to green and UV. Their visual environment, however, is rarely considered. Here, we built a UV-green camera to record footage from mouse habitats. We found chromatic contrast to greatly diverge in the upper but not the lower visual field, an environmental difference that may underlie the species' superior colour discrimination in the upper visual field. Moreover, training an autoencoder on upper but not lower visual field scenes was sufficient for the emergence of colour-opponent filters. Furthermore, the upper visual field was biased towards dark UV contrasts, paralleled by more light-offset-sensitive cells in the ventral retina. Finally, footage recorded at twilight suggests that UV promotes aerial predator detection. Our findings support that natural scene statistics shaped early visual processing in evolution.{$<$}/p{$><$}h3{$>$}Lead contact{$<$}/h3{$>$} {$<$}p{$>$}Further information and requests for resources and reagents should be directed to and will be fulfilled by the Lead Contact, Thomas Euler (thomas.euler@cin.uni-tuebingen.de){$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {We have identified a novel, sixth type of intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cell (ipRGC) in the mouse\textemdash the M6 cell. Its spiny, highly branched dendritic arbor is bistratified, with dendrites restricted to the inner and outer margins of the inner plexiform layer, co-stratifying with the processes of other ipRGC types. We show that M6 cells are by far the most abundant ganglion cell type labeled in adult pigmented Cdh3-GFP BAC transgenic mice. A few M5 ipRGCs are also labeled, but no other RGC types were encountered. Several distinct subnuclei in the geniculate complex and the pretectum contain labeled retinofugal axons in the Cdh3-GFP mouse. These are presumably the principle central targets of M6 cells (as well as M5 cells). Projections from M6 cells to the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus were confirmed by retrograde tracing, suggesting they contribute to pattern vision. M6 cells have low levels of melanopsin expression and relatively weak melanopsin-dependent light responses. They also exhibit strong synaptically driven light responses. Their dendritic fields are the smallest and most abundantly branched of all ipRGCs. They have small receptive fields and strong antagonistic surrounds. Despite deploying dendrites partly in the OFF sublamina, M6 cells appear to be driven exclusively by the ON pathway, suggesting that their OFF arbor, like those of certain other ipRGCs, may receive ectopic input from passing ON bipolar cells axons in the OFF sublayer.},

  abstract = {Convolutional Neural Networks have been proposed as suitable frameworks to model biological vision. Some of these artificial networks showed representational properties that rival primate performances in object recognition. In this paper we explore how color is encoded in a trained artificial network. It is performed by estimating a color selectivity index for each neuron, which allows us to describe the neuron activity to a color input stimuli. The index allows us to classify whether they are color selective or not and if they are of a single or double color. We have determined that all five convolutional layers of the network have a large number of color selective neurons. Color opponency clearly emerges in the first layer, presenting 4 main axes (Black-White, Red-Cyan, Blue-Yellow and Magenta-Green), but this is reduced and rotated as we go deeper into the network. In layer 2 we find a denser hue sampling of color neurons and opponency is reduced almost to one new main axis, the Bluish-Orangish coinciding with the dataset bias. In layers 3, 4 and 5 color neurons are similar amongst themselves, presenting different type of neurons that detect specific colored objects (e.g., orangish faces), specific surrounds (e.g., blue sky) or specific colored or contrasted object-surround configurations (e.g. blue blob in a green surround). Overall, our work concludes that color and shape representation are successively entangled through all the layers of the studied network, revealing certain parallelisms with the reported evidences in primate brains that can provide useful insight into intermediate hierarchical spatio-chromatic representations.},

However, causal evidence for this hypothesis has been equivocal, particularly beyond the specific case of face-selective sub-regions of IT. Here, we directly tested this hypothesis by pharmacologically inactivating individual, millimeter-scale sub-regions of IT while monkeys performed several object discrimination tasks, interleaved trial-by-trial. First, we observed that IT inactivation resulted in reliable contralateral-biased task-selective behavioral deficits. Moreover, inactivating different IT sub-regions resulted in different patterns of task deficits, each predicted by that sub-region's neuronal object discriminability. Finally, the similarity between different inactivation effects was tightly related to the anatomical distance between corresponding inactivation sites. Taken together, these results provide direct evidence that IT cortex causally supports general core object recognition, and that the underlying IT codes are topographically organized.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

Exploring molecular approaches to increase yield genetic gain has been one of the main challenges for soybean breeders and geneticists. Agronomic traits such as maturity, plant height, and seed weight have been found to contribute to yield. In this study, a total of 250 soybean accessions were genotyped with 10,259 high-quality SNPs postulated from genotyping by sequencing (GBS) and evaluated for grain yield, maturity, plant height, and seed weight over three years. A genome-wide association study (GWAS) was performed using a Bayesian Information and Linkage Disequilibrium Iteratively Nested Keyway (BLINK) model. Genomic selection (GS) was evaluated using a ridge regression best linear unbiased predictor (rrBLUP) model. The results revealed that 20, 31, 37, and 23 SNPs were significantly associated with maturity, plant height, seed weight, and yield, respectively; Many SNPs were mapped to previously described maturity and plant height loci (               E2               ,               E4               , and               Dt1               ) and a new plant height locus was mapped to chromosome 20. Candidate genes were found in the vicinity of the two SNPs with the highest significant levels associated with yield, maturity, plant height, seed weight, respectively. A 11.5-Mb region of chromosome 10 was associated with both yield and seed weight. Overall, the accuracy of GS was dependent on the trait, year, and population structure, and high accuracy indicates that these agronomic traits can be selected in molecular breeding through GS. The SNP markers identified in this study can be used to improve yield and agronomic traits through the marker-assisted selection and GS in breeding programs.},

One of the most recent and interesting applications of computed X-ray tomography (CT) is the analysis of soil blocks, coming from excavations, in order to seek for finds of different kinds and materials possibly contained therein. For this purpose, both medical and industrial CT scanners have been employed. In this paper, the application of a CT instrument specifically designed and developed for the analysis of Cultural Heritage materials is presented. We analysed a soil block extracted from a necropolis in the Italian region of Abruzzo and probably dating back to the VI-IV century B.C., which was found to contain a bronze belt.},

It is argued that investigators using subjective scaling should calibrate their subjects in some way because idiosyncratic responses can alter averaged scaling estimates. In this experiment task contrast was varied and estimates of visual performance (speed and accuracy) were collected simultaneously with subjective responses on seven-point semantic scales. Subjects exhibited sterotypical behaviour on the performance measures; their scaling responses were quite idiosyncratic, although some subjective responses to the experimental parameters varied like the performance responses. It is argued that visual performance measures could be used to calibrate subjective scaling responses.},

Much has been learned over the past couple of decades about light as a stimulus for circadian system regulation, so it is appropriate that these discussions take place. The present paper develops an argument for adopting circadian stimulus as a metric for quantifying light in architectural spaces. The circadian stimulus metric (a) was developed from several lines of biophysical research, including those from basic retinal neurophysiology; (b) has been validated in several controlled experiments; and (c) has been used successfully in a number of real-world applications. Any discussions of new metrics should take each of these foundational points into consideration.},

Although qualitative comparisons between the human circadian and visual systems can be made, there still remains some uncertainty in quantitatively predicting exactly how the circadian system will respond to different light exposures reaching the retina. This paper discusses attempts to model the spectral sensitivity of the circadian system. Each of the models discussed here varies in terms of its complexity and its consideration of retinal neuroanatomy and neurophysiology. Future testing to validate or improve any of these computational models will require a targeted hypothesis, as well as a suitably high level of experimental control before one model can be rejected in favour of another. Until specific hypotheses are formulated and tested, it would be premature to recommend international acceptance of any model or system of circadian photometry.},

  abstract = {Chromatic discrimination data show that a smaller physical stimulus change is required to detect a change in hue than to detect a change in saturation [Palette30, 21 (1968); Proc. R. Soc. London Ser. B283, 20160164 (2016)PRLBA40080-464910.1098/rspb.2016.0164], and, on this basis, it has been suggested that hue and saturation are carried in different neural channels [Color Space and Its Divisions: Color Order from Antiquity to the Present (Wiley, 2003), p.\&\#x00A0;311]. We used an adaptation paradigm to test explicitly for separate mechanisms, measuring hue and saturation detection thresholds before and after adaptation to hue and saturation stimuli. Within-condition adaptation did not elevate detection thresholds significantly more than between-condition adaptation. We therefore did not find psychophysical evidence for a neural channel that extracts hue thresholds more effectively than the neural channel or channels that determine saturation thresholds.},

  abstract = {Primates are apparently unique amongst the mammals in possessing trichromatic colour vision. However, not all primates are trichromatic. Amongst the haplorhine (higher) primates, the catarrhines possess uniformly trichromatic colour vision, whereas most of the platyrrhine species exhibit polymorphic colour vision, with a variety of dichromatic and trichromatic phenotypes within the population. It has been suggested that trichromacy in primates and the reflectance functions of certain tropical fruits are aspects of a coevolved seed\textendash dispersal system: primate colour vision has been shaped by the need to find coloured fruits amongst foliage, and the fruits themselves have evolved to be salient to primates and so secure dissemination of their seeds. We review the evidence for and against this hypothesis and we report an empirical test: we show that the spectral positioning of the cone pigments found in trichromatic South American primates is well matched to the task of detecting fruits against a background of leaves. We further report that particular trichromatic platyrrhine phenotypes may be better suited than others to foraging for particular fruits under particular conditions of illumination; and we discuss possible explanations for the maintenance of polymorphic colour vision amongst the platyrrhines.},

The test achieves a good separation of protan and deutan subjects and reveals the large range of chromatic sensibilities among anomalous trichromats. As a population, dichromats had higher thresholds on the triton axis of the test than did normals. In an extension of the test, full discrimination ellipses were measured for normal and colour-deficient observers. The nature of anomalous trichromacy is discussed and the possibility is raised that hybrid genes, resulting from genetic recombination, may code for incorrectly labelled or functionally impaired molecules.},

However, this notion has been supported primarily by data from languages of industrialized societies. In contrast, recent research on a language from a nonindustrialized society has called this idea into question. We examine color-naming data from languages of 110 nonindustrialized societies and show that (i) best-example choices for color terms in these languages cluster near the prototypes for English white, black, red, green, yellow, and blue, and (ii) best-example choices cluster more tightly across languages than do the centers of category extensions, suggesting that universal best examples (foci) may be the source of universal tendencies in color naming.},

  abstract = {The recognition that animals sense the world in a different way than we do has unlocked important lines of research in ecology and evolutionary biology. In practice, the subjective study of natural stimuli has been permitted by perceptual spaces, which are graphical models of how stimuli are perceived by a given animal. Because colour vision is arguably the best-known sensory modality in most animals, a diversity of colour spaces are now available to visual ecologists, ranging from generalist and basic models allowing rough but robust predictions on colour perception, to species-specific, more complex models giving accurate but context-dependent predictions. Selecting among these models is most often influenced by historical contingencies that have associated models to specific questions and organisms; however, these associations are not always optimal. The aim of this review is to provide visual ecologists with a critical perspective on how models of colour space are built, how well they perform and where their main limitations are with regard to their most frequent uses in ecology and evolutionary biology. We propose a classification of models based on their complexity, defined as whether and how they model the mechanisms of chromatic adaptation and receptor opponency, the nonlinear association between the stimulus and its perception, and whether or not models have been fitted to experimental data. Then, we review the effect of modelling these mechanisms on predictions of colour detection and discrimination, colour conspicuousness, colour diversity and diversification, and for comparing the perception of colour traits between distinct perceivers. While a few rules emerge (e.g. opponent log\textendash linear models should be preferred when analysing very distinct colours), in general model parameters still have poorly known effects. Colour spaces have nonetheless permitted significant advances in ecology and evolutionary biology, and more progress is expected if ecologists compare results between models and perform behavioural experiments more routinely. Such an approach would further contribute to a better understanding of colour vision and its links to the behavioural ecology of animals. While visual ecology is essentially a transfer of knowledge from visual sciences to evolutionary ecology, we hope that the discipline will benefit both fields more evenly in the future.},

The majority of techniques that extract the illuminant color assume that the illumination is constant across the scene. This, however, is not often the case. We propose an illuminant-color estimation method which is based on robust local illuminant estimates. There are no assumptions on the number or type of illuminants. An illuminant color estimate is obtained independently from distinct image mini-regions. From these mini-regions a robust local illumination color is computed by consensus. These local estimates are then used in deriving the chromaticity of the dominant illuminants. Experiments on an established benchmark database of real-world images show that our technique performs comparably to uniform-illuminant estimation methods. Furthermore, extensive tests on real-world images show that we can reliably process mixed illuminant scenes.},

We determined the temporal characteristics of chromatic adaptation for appearance and discrimination along different color directions. Subjects were adapted to a large uniform background made up of a CRT screen and a 45\texttimes 64\textdegree{} wall, illuminated by computer controlled lamps. After an instant change in background color along a red\textendash green or blue\textendash yellow color axis, we measured thresholds for the detection of increments along the same axes at fixed times between 25 ms and 121 s. Analogously, color appearance was determined using achromatic matching. Three components of adaptation could be identified by their temporal characteristics. A slow exponential time course of adaptation with a half-life of about 20 s was common to appearance and discrimination. A faster component with a half-life of 40\textendash 70 ms \textemdash{} probably due to photoreceptor adaptation \textemdash{} was also common to both. Exclusive for color appearance, there was a third, extremely rapid mechanism with a half-life faster than 10 ms. This instantaneous process explained more than 50\% of total adaptation for color appearance and could be shown to act in a multiplicative manner. We conclude that this instantaneous adaptation mechanism for color appearance is situated at a later processing stage, after mechanisms common to appearance and discrimination, and is based on multiplicative spatial interactions rather than on local, temporal adaptational processes. Color appearance, and thus color constancy, seems to be determined in large part by cortical computations.},

  abstract = {In 1976 the CIE recommended two colour difference formulae, the CIELAB and CIELUV formulae, to promote uniformity of practice pending the development of a better formula. While some of the arguments in favour of the recommendation were political, there were also sound technical reasons for choosing the two formulae. The discussions leading to the recommendation and the reasons that led the CIE to its decision are reviewed. In particular the reasons for the modification of the 1964 (U*, V*, W*) formula to arrive at the CIELUV formula are given, and the derivation of the constants (116, 16, 500 and 200) in the CIELAB formula is explained. Most of the data presented are taken from CIE Committee minutes and correspondence.},

  abstract = {El reconeixement d'objectes \'es potser la tasca m\'es important que un sistema aut\`onom, ja sigui biol\`ogic o artificial, necessita realitzar. En el context de la visi\'o humana, aix\`o s'aconsegueix parcialment a trav\'es del reconeixement del color de les superf\'icies malgrat els canvis en la distribuci\'o espectral de la llum, propietat anomenada const\`ancia de color. El reconeixement correcte del color de les superf\'icies \'es pot realitzar adequadament mitjan\c{c}ant la correspond\`encia entre categories de color sense la necessitat d'ajustar exactament els mateixos colors, aleshores la const\`ancia de color categ\`orica juga probablement un paper important per tal d'aconseguir amb \`exit el reconeixement d'objectes. El principal objectiu d'aquest treball \'es estudiar la relaci\'o entre la const\`ancia de color i la percepci\'o categ\`orica del color. Estudis anteriors de const\`ancia de color han mostrat la influ\`encia de factors tals com les propietats espai-crom\`atiques de l'entorn, particularitats individuals dels observadors, sem\`antica, etc... Malgrat tot, aquestes influ\`encies nom\'es s'han estudiat breument de forma sistem\`atica. Per solucionar-ho, hem desenvolupat una nova aproximaci\'o a la const\`ancia de color, la qual inclou la percepci\'o categ\`orica dels individus, l'estructura categ\`orica de l'entorn, i les seves interrelacions, resultant en una caracteritzaci\'o m\'es comprensiva del fenomen. En el nostre estudi, primer hem desenvolupat un nou m\`etode per tal d'analitzar l'estructura categ\`orica 3D de l'espai de color, la qual ens ha perm\`es caracteritzar la percepci\'o categ\`orica de cada individu i tamb\'e quantificar les variacions entre individus en termes de la forma i la localitzaci\'o dels centroides de les regions 3D categ\`oriques. Seguidament, hem desenvolupat un nou paradigma de const\`ancia de color, anomenat \&quot;chromatic setting\&quot;, el qual permet mesurar de forma precisa la localitzaci\'o de nou punts categ\`oricament rellevants en l'espai de color sota una ill.luminaci\'o envolvent. Adicionalment, hem derivat a partir d'aquestes mesures un nou \'index de const\`ancia de color, el qual t\'e en compte la magnitud i la orientaci\'o crom\`atica de l'il.lumiant, influ\`encies de la mem\`oria i les interrelacions entre colors, i tamb\'e un model d'assignaci\'o de noms de color ajustat a l'estat d'adaptaci\'o de cada observador. A partir dels nostres resultats concloem: (1) Existeixen \`amplies variacions entre individus respecte l'estructura categ\`orica de l'espai de color, i pertant l'abilitat d'assignar noms de color varia significativament per\`o aquesta no est\`a ben predita per les abilitats discriminatives de baix nivell; (2) L'an\`alisi de l'espai mitj\`a d'assignaci\'o de noms de color suggereix la necessitat d'afegir tres nous \&quot;basic colour terms\&quot; (\&quot;turquoise\&quot;, \&quot;lilac\&quot; i \&quot;lime\&quot; ) per tal d'optimitzar la comunicaci\'o de color; (3) El \&quot;chromatic setting\&quot; ha millorat la precisi\'o dels models lineals m\'es complexos de const\`ancia de color, aix\'i suggerint que altres mecanismes que no pas els d'adaptaci\'o al guany dels cons poden ser m\'es adequats per tal d'explicar el fenomen de la const\`ancia de color; (4) L'estructura categ\`orica de l'espai de color \'es en general estable sota canvis d'il.luminant quan s'usen entorns categ\`oricament balancejats; (5) Existeix inconst\`ancia de color per entorns categ\`oricament no balancejats i pertant indicant que la informaci\'o categ\`orica percebuda en les etapes inicials de l'adaptaci\'o pot condicionar la percepci\'o categ\`orica posterior.},

  abstract = {Visual area V4 is a midtier cortical area in the ventral visual pathway. It is crucial for visual object recognition and has been a focus of many studies on visual attention. However, there is no unifying view of V4's role in visual processing. Neither is there an understanding of how its role in feature processing interfaces with its role in visual attention. This review captures our current knowledge of V4, largely derived from electrophysiological and imaging studies in the macaque monkey. Based on recent discovery of functionally specific domains in V4, we propose that the unifying function of V4 circuitry is to enable selective extraction of specific functional domain-based networks, whether it be by bottom-up specification of object features or by top-down attentionally driven selection.},

Observers judged lightness and chroma of stimuli that varied in both dimensions in a paired-comparison task. We modeled how changes in one dimension influenced judgment of the other. An additive model best fit the data in all conditions except for judgment of red chroma where there was a small but significant interaction. Lightness negatively contributed to perception of chroma for red, blue, and green hues but not for yellow. The method permits quantification of lightness and chroma contributions to color appearance.},

  abstract = {Recent publications in the Journal of Biological Rhythms have focused on the hypothesis that the property of melanopsin bistability is functionally translated to in vivo mammalian physiology. Physiological consequences of photopigment bistability likely can be inferred from the more extensive invertebrate literature. In invertebrates, photopigment bistability results in (a) photoreceptor independence from specialized chromophore regenerating systems, (b) long-wavelength enhancement of a blue light effect, (c) expression of a prolonged depolarization afterpotential following intense blue light stimulation, and (d) photopigment endocytosis following chronic short-wavelength light exposure. If analogous physiological phenomena result from melanopsin bistability in mammals, then one can take advantage of the spectral composition of a light source to modulate its impact on photoentrainment and other light-dependent circadian phenomena. In any event, investigators studying phenomena that are affected by photic stimulation of intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells should detail the spectral composition of their light sources before, during, and after an experimental photic stimulus.},

We find that a three dimensional Euclidean representation accounts for most of the variation in the Euclidean distances among the 1269 Munsell color spectra. We interpret the three dimensional Euclidean representation of the spectral data in terms of the Munsell color space. In addition, we analyzed a data set with a large number of natural objects and found that the spectral profiles required four basis factors for adequate representation in Euclidean space. We conclude that four basis factors are required in general but that in special cases, like the Munsell system, three basis factors are adequate for precise characterization. \textcopyright{} 2003 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

We looked for such proof in monkeys trained to discriminate between two mechanical flutter stimuli applied sequentially to the fingertips. Microelectrodes were inserted into clusters of quickly adapting (QA) neurons of the primary somatosensory cortex (S1), and the first or both stimuli were then substituted with trains of current pulses during the discrimination task. Psychophysical performance with artificial stimulus frequencies was almost identical to that measured with the natural stimulus frequencies. Our results indicate that microstimulation can be used to elicit a memorizable and discriminable analog range of percepts, and shows that activation of the QA circuit of S1 is sufficient to initiate all subsequent neural processes associated with flutter discrimination.},

  abstract = {The geometry that describes the relationship among colors, and the neural mechanisms that support color vision, are unsettled. Here, we use multivariate analyses of measurements of brain activity obtained with magnetoencephalography to reverse-engineer a geometry of the neural representation of color space. The analyses depend upon determining similarity relationships among the spatial patterns of neural responses to different colors and assessing how these relationships change in time. We evaluate the approach by relating the results to universal patterns in color naming. Two prominent patterns of color naming could be accounted for by the decoding results: the greater precision in naming warm colors compared to cool colors evident by an interaction of hue and lightness, and the preeminence among colors of reddish hues. Additional experiments showed that classifiers trained on responses to color words could decode color from data obtained using colored stimuli, but only at relatively long delays after stimulus onset. These results provide evidence that perceptual representations can give rise to semantic representations, but not the reverse. Taken together, the results uncover a dynamic geometry that provides neural correlates for color appearance and generates new hypotheses about the structure of color space.},

This article focuses on the Color Vector Graphic and Local Chroma Shift (IES Rcs,hj), discussing the calculation methods for these evaluation tools and providing context for the interpretation of the values. We illustrate why and how the Color Vector Graphic and Local Chroma Shift values capture information about color rendition that is impossible to describe with average measures (such as CIE Ra, IES Rf, or IES Rg) but that is pertinent to more completely quantifying color rendition and to understanding human evaluations of color quality in the built environment. We also present alternatives for quantifying the Color Vector Graphic and Local Chroma Shift values, which can inform the development of future measures.},

  abstract = {An experiment was conducted to evaluate how subjective impressions of a light source's colour quality depend upon the details of the shifts it causes in the colour appearance of illuminated objects. Twenty-eight participants each evaluated 26 lighting conditions in a 3.1\,m by 3.7\,m room filled with objects selected to cover a range of hue, saturation, and lightness. IES TM-30-15 Fidelity Index (Rf) values ranged from 64 to 93, IES TM-30 Gamut Index (Rg) values ranging from 79 to 117, and IES TM-30 red chroma shift (Rcs,h1) values ranging from -19\% to 26\%. All lighting conditions had the same nominal illuminance and chromaticity. Participants were asked to rate each condition on eight point scales for saturated\textendash dull, normal\textendash shifted, and like\textendash dislike, as well as classifying the condition as one of saturated, dull, normal, or shifted. The findings suggest that gamut shape is more important than average gamut area for modeling human preference, with red playing a more important role than other hues. Average fidelity alone is a weak predictor of human perception, especially CIE Ra. Nine of the top 12 rated products had a CIE Ra value of 73 or less, which indicates that the criteria of CIE Ra\,{$\geq$}\,80 may be excluding many preferred light sources.},

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$>$}Information on peripheral color perception is far from being sufficient since it was predominantly obtained using small stimuli, limited ranges of eccentricities, and sophisticated experimental conditions. Our purpose was to consider a possibility of facilitating technical realization of the classical method of asymmetric color matching (ACM) developed by Moreland and Cruz (1959) for assessing appearance of color stimuli in the peripheral visual field (VF). We adopted the ACM method by employing two smartphones to implement matching procedure at various eccentricities. Although smartphones were successfully employed in vision studies, we are aware that some photometric parameters of smartphone displays are not sufficiently precise to ensure accurate color matching in foveal vision; moreover, certain technical characteristics of commercially available devices are variable. In the present study we provide evidence that, despite these shortages, smartphones can be applied for general and wide investigations of the peripheral vision. In our experiments, the smartphones were mounted on a mechanical perimeter to simultaneously present colored stimuli foveally and peripherally. Trying to reduce essential discomfort and fatigue experienced by most observers in peripheral vision studies, we did not apply bite bars, pupil dilatation, and Maxwellian view. The ACM measurements were performed without prior training of observers and in a wide range of eccentricities, varying between 0 and 95 degrees. Color appearance was measured in the HSV color space coordinates as a function of eccentricity and stimulus luminance. We demonstrate that our easy-to-conduct method provides a reliable means to estimate color appearance in the peripheral vision and to assess inter-individual differences.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {It is good scientific practice to the report an appropriate estimate of effect size and a confidence interval (CI) to indicate the precision with which a population effect was estimated. For comparisons of 2 independent groups, a probability-based effect size estimator (A) that is equal to the area under a receiver operating characteristic curve and closely related to the popular Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney nonparametric statistical tests has many appealing properties (e.g., easy to understand, robust to violations of parametric assumptions, insensitive to outliers). We performed a simulation study to compare 9 analytic and 3 empirical (bootstrap) methods for constructing a CI for A that can yield very different CIs for the same data. The experimental design crossed 6 factors to yield a total of 324 cells representing challenging but realistic data conditions. Results were examined using several criteria, with emphasis placed on the extent to which observed CI coverage probabilities approximated nominal levels. Based on the simulation study results, the bias-corrected and accelerated bootstrap method is recommended for constructing a CI for the A statistic; bootstrap methods also provided the least biased and most accurate standard error of A. An empirical illustration examining score differences on a citation-based index of scholarly impact across faculty at low-ranked versus high-ranked research universities underscores the importance of choosing an appropriate CI method.},

The probability of superiority (A) has many appealing characteristics, such as being robust to parametric assumptions, easy to understand, and generalizable. While A was originally created to compare scores from two discrete groups, extensions of the statistic have been created to allow researchers to use A for correlated samples, as well as for more than two conditions. Former research on methods for creating confidence intervals for A suggests the use of bootstrap methods, which can be used for each variation of calculating A. The use of bootstrapping methods for calculating CIs and the various extensions of A have been brought together to create a package, RProbSup, which allows users to easily calculate different variations of A, its standard error (SE), and CI. This paper illustrates how to use RProbSup and highlights the benefits of using these statistical methods.},

  abstract = {Light can elicit an alerting response in humans, independent from acute melatonin suppression. Recent studies have shown that red light significantly increases daytime and nighttime alertness. The main goal of the present study was to further investigate the effects of daytime light exposure on performance, biomarkers and measures of alertness. It was hypothesized that, compared to remaining in dim light, daytime exposure to narrowband long-wavelength (red) light or polychromatic (2568K) light would induce greater alertness and shorter response times. Thirteen subjects experienced three lighting conditions: dim light ({$<$}5lux), red light ({$\lambda$}max=631nm, 213lux, 1.1W/m2), and white light (2568K, 361lux, 1.1W/m2). The presentation order of the lighting conditions was counterbalanced across the participants and each participant saw a different lighting condition each week. Our results demonstrate, for the first time, that red light can increase short-term performance as shown by the significant (p{$<$}0.05) reduced response time and higher throughput in performance tests during the daytime. There was a significant decrease (p{$<$}0.05) in alpha power and alpha\textendash theta power after exposure to the white light, but this alerting effect did not translate to better performance. Alpha power was significantly reduced after red light exposure in the middle of the afternoon. There was no significant effect of light on cortisol and alpha amylase. The present results suggest that red light can be used to increase daytime performance.},

  abstract = {Physiological and behavioral evidence suggests that the activity of direction selective neurons in visual cortex underlies the perception of moving visual stimuli. We tested this hypothesis by measuring the effects of cortical microstimulation on perceptual judgements of motion direction. To accomplish this, rhesus monkeys were trained to discriminate the direction of motion in a near-threshold, stochastic motion display. For each experiment, we positioned a microelectrode in the middle of a cluster of neurons that shared a common preferred direction of motion. The psychophysical task was then adjusted so that the visual display was presented directly over the neurons' receptive field. The monkeys were required to discriminate between motion shown either in the direction preferred by the neurons or in the opposite direction. On half the trials of an experiment, we applied electrical microstimulation while monkeys viewed the motion display. We hypothesized that enhancing the neurons' discharge rate would introduce a directionally specific signal into the cortex and thereby influence the monkeys' choices on the discrimination task. We compared the monkeys' performance on ``stimulated'' and ``nonstimulated'' trials in 139 experiments; all trials within an experiment were presented in random order. Statistically significant effects of microstimulation were obtained in 89 experiments. In 86 of the 89 experiments with significant effects (97\%), the monkeys indicated that motion was in the neurons' preferred direction more frequently on stimulated trials than on nonstimulated trials. The data demonstrate a functional link between the activity of direction selective neurons and perceptual judgements of motion direction.},

SWAP is also more successful for detecting changes in vision as glaucoma progresses. Results from various visual function-specific tests, including SWAP, suggest that there are individual differences in ocular hypertensive and glaucoma eyes in the subtype of ganglion cell first affected. However, the disease targets the same retinal area for all function-specific tests that show a deficit in a given individual. Psychophysical tests of vision are critical to understand glaucoma's effect on retinal ganglion cells, to verify the success or failure of treatment including new neuroprotective agents, and to determine the relationship of genetic markers for glaucoma to the presence and progress of the disease.},

  abstract = {Chromatic selectivity has been studied extensively in various visual areas at different stages of visual processing in the macaque brain. In these studies, color stimuli defined in the Derrington-Krauskopf-Lennie (DKL) color space with a limited range of cone contrast were typically used in early stages, whereas those defined in the Commission Internationale de l'Eclairage (CIE) color space, based on human psychophysical measurements across the gamut of the display, were often used in higher visual areas. To understand how the color information is processed along the visual pathway, it is necessary to compare color selectivity obtained in different areas on a common color space. In the present study, we tested whether the neural color selectivity obtained in DKL space can be predicted from responses obtained in CIE space and whether stimuli with limited cone contrast are sufficient to characterize neural color selectivity. We found that for most V4 neurons, there was a strong correlation between responses measured using the two chromatic coordinate systems, and the color selectivities obtained with the two stimulus sets were comparable. However, for some neurons preferring high- or low-saturation colors, stimuli defined in DKL color space did not adequately capture the neural color selectivity. This is mainly due to the use of stimuli within a limited range of cone contrast. We conclude that regardless of the choice of color space, the sampling of colors across the entire gamut is important to characterize neural color selectivity fully or to compare color selectivities in different areas so as to understand color representation in the visual system.},

In the present work a series of visual colour rendering investigations are described and their correlation with the current method of calculating colour rendering index as well as with possible updates of the calculation method is evaluated. Visual experiments have shown that the CIE Test Method is not a good predictor of visual perception. A method based on calculating colour differences using the CIECAM02 colour appearance model provides better correlation between visual and calculated colour rendering values.},

Two subjects performed hue-matching experiments using simultaneously presented monochromatic stimuli of unequal corneal irradiances. For seven wavelengths between 560 and 620 nm, the shift of hue was measured over a 1000:1 range of irradiances, in steps of about 3:1. Contrary to previous reports of the Bezold\textendash Br\"ucke hue shift, the hue of a given wavelength is not a monotonic function of irradiance, nor is there an invariant wavelength in this spectral region. Some previous models of the Bezold\textendash Br\"ucke effect in the literature are incompatible with the present data. We propose a physiologically plausible, analytic form for nonlinearities of the red and green color systems, and a simple model for the physiological correlate of hue, which together are capable of predicting some major characteristics of the present data and of previously reported data.},

In this study, we investigated colour-tone mapping in both normal trichromats and in people with congenital blindness. Participants were asked to match tones of differing pitch to named colours. In both cases, the tones selected varied consistently with the colour. The blind responses were similar to those of the trichromats, except in the case of red and green; the blind did not differentiate these colours, whereas the trichromats associated red with a higher tone and green with a lower tone. Otherwise, the results are consistent with a well-established association between pitch and lightness, with lighter colours associated with higher tones, and darker colours with lower tones. Because the blind never had any sensory experience of colour, their matching of colour to pitch is most likely based on semantic understanding.},

  abstract = {Neuroscientists have long debated whether some regions of the human brain are exclusively engaged in a single specific mental process. Consistent with this view, fMRI has revealed cortical regions that respond selectively to certain stimulus classes such as faces. However, results from multivoxel pattern analyses (MVPA) challenge this view by demonstrating that category-selective regions often contain information about ``nonpreferred'' stimulus dimensions. But is this nonpreferred information causally relevant to behavior? Here we report a rare opportunity to test this question in a neurosurgical patient implanted for clinical reasons with strips of electrodes along his fusiform gyri. Broadband gamma electrocorticographic responses in multiple adjacent electrodes showed strong selectivity for faces in a region corresponding to the fusiform face area (FFA), and preferential responses to color in a nearby site, replicating earlier reports. To test the causal role of these regions in the perception of nonpreferred dimensions, we then electrically stimulated individual sites while the patient viewed various objects. When stimulated in the FFA, the patient reported seeing an illusory face (or ``facephene''), independent of the object viewed. Similarly, stimulation of color-preferring sites produced illusory ``rainbows.'' Crucially, the patient reported no change in the object viewed, apart from the facephenes and rainbows apparently superimposed on them. The functional and anatomical specificity of these effects indicate that some cortical regions are exclusively causally engaged in a single specific mental process, and prompt caution about the widespread assumption that any information scientists can decode from the brain is causally relevant to behavior.},

For art preservation and energy saving reasons this is not feasible. Museums often use light of 3500 K correlated colour temperature (CCT). A method is described that takes chromatic adaptation into consideration to determine the spectral power distribution producing least colour distortion of object colours while changing from a higher adaptation luminance at 6500 K to 3500 K illumination at a lower adaptation luminance. The method can be used for any CCT and adaptation luminance values.},

Each unique hue was measured at three luminance levels (0.5-log-unit steps). There were no significant changes in the spectral locations of red\textendash green equilibrium hues (unique blue and yellow) as a function of luminance level or age. In contrast, significant shifts in unique green loci occurred as a function of both age and luminance. Unique green loci shifted toward shorter wavelengths with age. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that with advancing age there is a parallel decline in the input of all three cone types to the red\textendash green chromatic channel and either a selective decline in short-wave-sensitive cone input to the yellow\textendash blue chromatic channel or a change in the way in which cone signals are combined within the yellow\textendash blue channel.},

We used a paradigm that allowed us to measure the perceived saturation of several standard color stimuli in many different directions of color space. We implemented this paradigm at different levels of luminance and varied background luminance relative to the luminance of our color stimuli in order to ensure the generality of our approach. We found that varying background luminance changed the relative saturation of the standard colors. Raising the overall luminance level did not have such an effect. We compared the results of our measurements to the predictions of the seven saturation measures. All of the measures could predict our observers' judgments of saturation reasonably well. The measures that are based on measurements of discrimination thresholds (LUV, LAB, CIECAM02) performed best on average. However, some of the perceptual effects induced by changing background luminance could not be predicted by any measure.},

The test spots were presented to the fovea and foveola in conditions that included M-cone isolation. 1\textdegree{} and 3.6 min arc tests were flashed for 200 ms on steady 8.6{${'}$}, 1\textdegree, or 10\textdegree{} monochromatic adapting fields (481, 530, 610, and 630 nm), or on mixtures of these fields, or on a dark field. Tests were flashed at 1, 2, 4, and 8 \texttimes{} thresholds. Field hue had little overall effect. Yellow, green, blue-green, and blue color-names were elicited, both for the foveal 1\textdegree{} tests and for 3.6 min tests confined to the S-cone free foveola. These data add to previous research by showing a contribution of M-cones to blueness on monochromatic fields, as well as on achromatic fields. Because the 500 and 530 nm tests appear green when presented steadily on these same fields, the M-cone contribution to blue may well be transitory. \textcopyright{} 2001 John Wiley \& Sons, Inc.

However, a population of atypical photoreceptive retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) expresses the photopigment melanopsin and is intrinsically photosensitive (ipRGCs). These ipRGCs are crucial for relaying light information from the retina to the brain to control circadian photoentrainment, pupillary light reflex, and sleep. ipRGCs were initially described as a uniform population involved solely in signaling irradiance for non-image forming functions. Recent work, however, has uncovered that ipRGCs are unexpectedly diverse at the molecular, cellular and functional levels, and could even be involved in image formation. This review summarizes our current understanding of the diversity of ipRGCs and their various roles in modulating behavior.},

  abstract = {Preceding the development of modern biological techniques, psychophysical experimentation and careful reasoning alone yielded an accurate account of human color perception predicated upon three opponent processes: blue versus yellow, red versus green and white versus black (Hurvich and Jameson, 1957). That is, when one of the opponent pairs, say blue, is perceived the other, yellow, is necessarily absent. The discovery, nearly five decades ago, by De Valois, Abramov and Jacobs of neurons early in the visual pathway with spectral characteristics similar to the theorized opponent interactions provided a plausible neurobiological substrate for hue perception (De Valois et al., 1966). In the decades since De Valois and colleagues published their seminal findings (De Valois et al., 1966), discrepancies between the properties of the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) cells reported and behavioral evidence have weakened the interpretation that these early visual cells directly map to human color perception (Stockman and Brainard, 2010). In particular, the contribution of S-cones to each opponent system has continued to be the subject of considerable experimental attention (Neitz and Neitz, 2011; Solomon and Lennie, 2007). On the basis of these discrepancies, De Valois and De Valois proposed a cortical transformation of LGN signals amounting to a rotation of the color axes (De Valois and De Valois, 1993). In light of evolutionary constraints and evidence from the genetic introduction of a third class of cones to a dichromatic retina (Mancuso et al., 2009), a simplied version of the De Valois model has been proposed (Neitz and Neitz, 2011; Mancuso et al., 2010; Schmidt et al., 2014). This model posits that the spectral opponency necessary to account for hue perception is already present in a subset of midget ganglion cells. Early reports from de Monasterio et al. (1975; 1978) described such retinal cells, with more recent support from a large sample of LGN neurons taken by Tailby et al. (2008). The goal of the research presented here was to directly test the hypothesis that hue perception is mediated by a small subset of midget ganglion cells that receive S-cone input via H2 horizontal cells.},

This distinction stems from studies that ablated melanopsin-expressing~intrinsically photosensitive RGCs (ipRGCs) and showed deficits in nonimage-forming behaviors, but not image vision. However, we show that the ON alpha RGC, a conventional RGC type, is intrinsically photosensitive in mammals. In addition to their classical response to fast changes in contrast through rod/cone signaling, melanopsin expression allows ON alpha RGCs to signal prior light exposure and environmental luminance over long periods of time. Consistent with the high contrast sensitivity of ON alpha RGCs, mice lacking either melanopsin or ON alpha RGCs have behavioral deficits in contrast sensitivity. These findings indicate a surprising role for melanopsin and ipRGCs in vision. Video Abstract},

Color information is computed by downstream neurons that compare relative activity across the three cone types. How cone signals are combined at a cellular scale has been more difficult to resolve. This is especially true near the fovea, where spectrally-opponent neurons in the parvocellular pathway draw excitatory input from a single cone and thus even the smallest stimulus will engage multiple color-signaling neurons. We used an adaptive optics microstimulator to target individual and pairs of cones with light. Consistent with prior work, we found that color percepts elicited from individual cones were predicted by their spectral sensitivity, although there was considerable variability even between cones within the same spectral class. The appearance of spots targeted at two cones were predicted by an average of their individual activations. However, two cones of the same subclass elicited percepts that were systematically more saturated than predicted by an average. Together, these observations suggest both spectral opponency and prior experience influence the appearance of small spots.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

Spectral sensitivities of 'green' and 'red' cones, determined over the entire visible region, show peaks near 530 and 560 nm respectively, and are remarkably similar to those of the old-world monkey Macaco fascicularis 2,3. They satisfactorily predict the photopic luminosity function, a measure of the sensitivity of cone-mediated human vision to light of different wavelengths. The kinetics of the light responses of human cones also appeared similar to those of macaque cones: the time to peak response to a dim flash was 50\textendash 100 ms and there was a characteristic undershoot during recovery.},

Despite these criticisms, this research practice is not uncommon, probably because it appeals to researcher's intuition to collect more data to push an indecisive result into a decisive region. In this contribution, we investigate the properties of a procedure for Bayesian hypothesis testing that allows optional stopping with unlimited multiple testing, even after each participant. In this procedure, which we call Sequential Bayes Factors (SBFs), Bayes factors are computed until an a priori defined level of evidence is reached. This allows flexible sampling plans and is not dependent upon correct effect size guesses in an a priori power analysis. We investigated the long-term rate of misleading evidence, the average expected sample sizes, and the biasedness of effect size estimates when an SBF design is applied to a test of mean differences between 2 groups. Compared with optimal NHST, the SBF design typically needs 50\% to 70\% smaller samples to reach a conclusion about the presence of an effect, while having the same or lower long-term rate of wrong inference.

Subjects viewed a series of specifically modified black and white disks and matched the resulting subjective color with a comparison field containing the color generated by additive mixing. Different phase relations between the apparently colored ring and the surround were tested. The color loci of all PIFCs were found to He on a plane hi receptor three-space which is given by the axis of the shortwave receptor excitation and a vector given by combining the middle and long wave receptor excitation directions in a fixed ratio of nearly 1:1. From the orientation of this plane it can be deduced that the blue-yellow opponent process (the blue-on-center cells) alone accounts for the different PIFCs.},

Here we show that neither memory nor perception are appropriately scaled in stimulus space; instead, they are based on a transformed similarity representation that is nonlinearly related to stimulus space. This result calls into question a foundational assumption of extant models of visual working memory. Once psychophysical similarity is taken into account, aspects of memory that have been thought to demonstrate a fixed working memory capacity of around three or four items and to require fundamentally different representations\textemdash across different stimuli, tasks and types of memory\textemdash can be parsimoniously explained with a unitary signal detection framework. These results have substantial implications for the study of visual memory and lead to a substantial reinterpretation of the relationship between perception, working memory and long-term memory.},

This paper examines issues concerning the need, nature, explanatory role, and justification for postulating such internalized constraints. In particular, I seek further clarification from Shepard on how best to understand his claim that principles of kinematic geometry underlie phenomena of motion perception.My primary focus is on the ecological validity of Shepard's kinematic constraint in the context of ordinary motion perception. First, I explore the analogy Shepard draws between internalized circadian rhythms and the supposed internalization of kinematic geometry. Next, questions are raised about how to interpret and justify applying results from his own and others' experimental studies of apparent motion to more everyday cases of motion perception in richer environments. Finally, some difficulties with Shepard's account of the evolutionary development of his kinematic constraint are considered.},

  abstract = {Museums must choose illumination that will optimize observers' aesthetic experiences without compromising preservation of the artworks. Typical lighting is 3000 K at 200 lux. We examined the effects of color temperature by comparing the same ``artwork'' under several different illuminants (in side-by-side miniature museum rooms); for each painting, observers rated the preference for seeing it under one of the two illuminants; this was repeated for all pairings of illuminants. Our observers preferred higher color temperatures at about 3600 K. Between viewing trials observers' visual systems were adapted to a specific illuminant. This had no effect on preferred illumination of an artwork. To explore a wider range of artworks, we developed a set of numerical scales that could be applied directly to individual pictures; these were viewed, one at a time, in a single simulated room illuminated by one of a series of illuminants. Again, observers preferred a color temperature of about 3600 K. In both studies there was a small interaction between illuminant and color gamut of a given painting. \textcopyright{} 2004 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

  abstract = {The original experimental work of CIE to establish a method for assessing the colour rendering properties of light sources has been analysed. The spectral power distribution of the Standard Warm White fluorescent lamp, used in that experiment to define a General Colour Rendering Index (Ra) equal to 50, is presented with extended spectral range and resolution. This lamp was used to compute new Ra indices when the CIE(1964)UVW formula was substituted by the CIELUV or the new, improved SVF colour space formula. Ten fluorescent and discharge lamps and two extra sets of colour samples were included in this investigation. The Special Colour Rendering Indices (Ri) for each sample of a set of 24 saturated colours show large deviations when the UVW formula is substituted by the SVF formula. Less variation is seen for the averaged Ra indices. However, for the Warm White de Luxe lamp investigated by the CIE committee, only the SVF formula yields a Ra index equal to that obtained by visual rating. The SVF formula includes a correction for chromatic adaptation that correlates well with physiological data. This improved adaptation transform makes it possible to use daylight illumination as a fixed reference source. This leads to drastic changes of the Ra-values, mainly due to a systematic degradation of Ra with decreasing correlated colour temperature. It is suggested that the use of the SVF formula, in combination with a set of 20 colour samples of constant lightness and saturation and with hues evenly distributed along the colour circle, will lead to an improved colour rendering index, tentatively called the Rb index. Our investigations indicate that, compared to the present CIE Ra index, only minor changes will result for the Standard, de Luxe and broad-band type of lamps. For modern energy saving lamps with irregular spectral power distribution, however, like three-three-band and most of the discharge lamps, the Rb index may deviate significantly and lead to more realistic values.},

The instantaneous amplitude modulations present in heart rate (AMHR) and breathing rate (AMBR) band frequencies of PPG were extracted from high-resolution time-frequency spectrum. HR and pulse pressure showed no significant changes during the protocol. The AMHR significantly (P{$<$};0.05) decreased at 100 ml through 900 ml blood loss from ear and finger probe sites. The mean percent decrease in AMHR at 900 ml blood loss compared to baseline value was 45.2\%, 42.0\%, and 42.3\% for ear, finger and forehead PPG signals, respectively. In addition, significant increases in AMBR were found due to blood loss in ear and finger PPG signals. Even without baseline AMHR values, 900 ml blood loss detection was shown possible with specificity and sensitivity both 87.5\% from ear PPG signals. The present technique has great potential to serve as a valuable tool in the intraoperative and trauma settings to detect hemorrhage.},

  abstract = {Melanopsin photoreception plays a vital role in irradiance detection for non-image forming responses to light. However, little is known about the involvement of melanopsin in emotional processing of luminance. When confronted with a gradient in light, organisms exhibit spatial movements relative to this stimulus. In rodents, behavioural light aversion (BLA) is a well-documented but poorly understood phenomenon during which animals attribute salience to light and remove themselves from it. Here, using genetically modified mice and an open field behavioural paradigm, we investigate the role of melanopsin in BLA. While wildtype (WT), melanopsin knockout (Opn4-/-) and rd/rd cl (melanopsin only (MO)) mice all exhibit BLA, our novel methodology reveals that isolated melanopsin photoreception produces a slow, potentiating response to light. In order to control for the involvement of pupillary constriction in BLA we eliminated this variable with topical atropine application. This manipulation enhanced BLA in WT and MO mice, but most remarkably, revealed light aversion in triple knockout (TKO) mice, lacking three elements deemed essential for conventional photoreception (Opn4-/- Gnat1-/- Cnga3-/-). Using a number of complementary strategies, we determined this response to be generated at the level of the retina. Our findings have significant implications for the understanding of how melanopsin signalling may modulate aversive responses to light in mice and humans. In addition, we also reveal a clear potential for light perception in TKO mice.},

  abstract = {We have documented previously a close relationship between neuronal activity in the middle temporal visual area (MT or V5) and behavioral judgments of motion (Newsome et al., 1989; Salzman et al., 1990; Britten et al., 1992; Britten et al., 1996). We have now used numerical simulations to try to understand how neural signals in area MT support psychophysical decisions. We developed a model that pools neuronal responses drawn from our physiological data set and compares average responses in different pools to produce psychophysical decisions. The structure of the model allows us to assess the relationship between ``neuronal'' input signals and simulated psychophysical performance using the same methods we have applied to real experimental data. We sought to reconcile three experimental observations: psychophysical performance (threshold sensitivity to motion stimuli embedded in noise), a trial-by-trial covariation between the neural response and the monkey's choices, and a modest correlation between pairs of MT neurons in their variable responses to identical visual stimuli. Our results can be most accurately simulated if psychophysical decisions are based on pools of at least 100 weakly correlated sensory neurons. The neurons composing the pools must include a broader range of sensitivities than we encountered in our MT recordings, presumably because of the inclusion of neurons whose optimal stimulus is different from the one being discriminated. Central sources of noise degrade the signal-to-noise ratio of the pooled signal, but this degradation is relatively small compared with the noise typically carried by single cortical neurons. This suggests that our monkeys base near-threshold psychophysical judgments on signals carried by populations of weakly interacting neurons; these populations include many neurons that are not tuned optimally for the particular stimuli being discriminated.},

The goal of this work is to study the effect of standard colorimetric observers and illuminant source combinations on the reconstruction of reflectance spectra of textile fabrics. Several computational approaches were introduced by using different combinations of D65, A and D75 illuminant sources and 2\textdegree{} and 10\textdegree{} standard colorimetric observers in reconstruction reflectance spectra from corresponding tristimulus values. The obtained results indicate that the accuracy of the estimation depends on the type of illuminant sources, standard observers and number of principal components. The best result was achieved by a 2\textdegree{} standard observer with more than four principal components. The optimal numbers of principal components for achieving the imperceptible colorimetric accuracy are 4 and 6 for 2\textdegree{} and 10\textdegree{} standard observers, respectively.},

Studying both sexes could help to rectify these public health problems, but incentive structures in publishing and career advancement deter many researchers from doing so. Moreover, funding agency directives to include male and female animals and human participants in grant proposals lack mechanisms to hold recipients accountable. In this Perspective, we highlight areas of behavioral, cellular and systems neuroscience in which fundamental sex differences have been identified, demonstrating that truly rigorous science must include males and females. We call for a cultural and structural change in how we conduct research and evaluate scientific progress, realigning our professional reward systems and experimental standards to produce a more equitable, representative and therefore translational body of knowledge.},

We performed experiments on chromatic induction with small, initially achromatic, targets on nine different colored surrounds ranging in color from blue to red. Using scaling of saturation as our measure of perceived color strength, we found that chromatic induction is at its maximum when the brightness contrast at the boundary between target and surroundings is minimal. This implies that the neural mechanism in the cerebral cortex that mediates the appearance of brightness at a boundary inhibits the activity of chromatic mechanisms at that same boundary. Observers matched the apparent brightness and luminance of each of the colored surrounds. For surround colors where brightness and luminance matches differ, brightness contrast, not luminance contrast, controls chromatic induction. These new findings, taken together with other evidence, require a new theory of color appearance that includes mutually inhibitory interactions between color and brightness mechanisms that are sensing color and brightness contrast at visual boundaries.},

  abstract = {For normal human observers, color is three-dimensional. The color appearance of any surface can be matched by adjusting just three variables (such as lightness, hue, and saturation). This trichromacy is mediated, but not ultimately explained, by the existence of three classes of photoreceptors -- retinal cones having peak sensitivities to longer, medium, and shorter wavelengths of visible light. Possibly, this trichromacy is the result of a more or less arbitrary compromise between (a) the larger number of dimensions required to represent the full spectral reflectance distributions of surfaces and (b) the smaller number of classes of retinal receptors needed to maintain, through denser retinal packing, higher spatial resolution for each receptor class. Alternatively, building on a linear model for color vision, as formulated by Maloney and Wandell, this paper seeks a less arbitrary basis for trichromacy in the prevailing degrees of freedom of terrestrial illumination. Natural selection may have favored trichromacy because it permits the achievement of color constancy despite terrestrial transformations of sunlight, which, unlike the variations in surface reflectances, have been limited to essentially three degrees of freedom. Any visual system, whether biological or artificial (including a system that requires merely an achromatic, shades-of-gray representation), can achieve constancy of color (and of lightness) only by first analyzing its optical input into three chromatic channels in order to compensate for the prevailing three degrees of freedom of terrestrial illumination.},

When subjects were presented with the colors themselves, the recovered color circle remained the same for the normally sighted but collapsed along the red-green dimension for the color-blind. Based on their rankings by color names, the totally blind subjects all fell outside the range of the color-normal subjects but partly overlapped the color-deficient subjects; a rare rod monochromat roughly approximated the color-normal subjects.

  abstract = {The appearance of a chromatic stimulus depends on more than the wavelengths composing it. The scientific literature has countless examples showing that spatial and temporal features of light influence the colors we see. Studying chromatic stimuli that vary over space, time, or direction of motion has a further benefit beyond predicting color appearance: the unveiling of otherwise concealed neural processes of color vision. Spatial or temporal stimulus variation uncovers multiple mechanisms of brightness and color perception at distinct levels of the visual pathway. Spatial variation in chromaticity and luminance can change perceived three-dimensional shape, an example of chromatic signals that affect a percept other than color. Chromatic objects in motion expose the surprisingly weak link between the chromaticity of objects and their physical direction of motion, and the role of color in inducing an illusory motion direction. Space, time, and motion\textemdash color's colleagues\textemdash reveal the richness of chromatic neural processing.},

  abstract = {We examine the use of linear spectral reflectance models for calibrating a color scanner to generate device-independent CIE XYZ values from scanner vectors. Polynomial regression approaches to color scanner calibration use parameterized functions to approximate the calibration mapping over a set of training colors. These approaches can perform poorly if the parameterized functions do not accurately model the structure of the desired calibration mapping. Several studies have shown that linear reflectance models accurately characterize a wide range of materials. By viewing color scanner calibration as reflectance estimation, we can incorporate linear reflectance models into the calibration process. We show that in most cases linear models do not constrain the calibration problem sufficiently to allow exact recovery of X, Y, Z from a scanner vector obtained with three filters. By examining a series of methods that exploit information about reflectance functions, however, we show that reflectance information can be used to improve the accuracy of calibration over that of standard methods applied to the same set of inputs.},

  abstract = {Adaptation to environmental light allows our visual system to compensate for dynamic changes in the visual environment for avoiding everyday hazards (e.g., misreading traffic lights) and for accurate reaching. We investigated the hypothesis that adaptation to coloured light is achieved not only via photoreceptors in the retina and monocular contrast adaptation, but also by a binocular process that may occur at the level of the cerebral cortex. In the present study, to determine the role of higher-order cortical binocular processes in adaptation to coloured light, participants were adapted to chromatic light such that the duration of adaptation during monocular processing differed from that during binocular processing. A dichoptic device was used to adapt each eye independently. The extent of after-effects, measured as the distance between the neutral points before and after adaptation to coloured light, depended on the duration of adaptation not only at the monocular level but also at a higher cortical level downstream from binocular fusion. Thus, contrast adaptation to coloured light occurs on at least two levels; it is a result of monocular processes at one level and binocular processes at the other, and each type of process exhibits different temporal characteristics. The results of this study suggest a significant cortical role in adaptation to changes in lighting conditions or the optical environment, including the effects of age on the eye, and the necessity of further investigation to clarify the functional connection between chromatic adaptation by photo-receptors and chromatic adaptation by cortical systems.},

  abstract = {In a series of studies on lightness perception, subjects performed a discrimination between two simulated reflectances appearing under a simulated illumination modulating sinusoidally. By manipulating the period of modulation, the time dependence of the lightness judgment was measured. If the modulations of illumination are faster than the operation of a mechanism responsible for lightness perception, the mechanism cannot compensate for the modulation, and lightness discrimination performance should suffer. Thus, the time course of lightness perception can be assessed by measuring increases of performance as the period of modulation increases. There are three classes of mechanisms hypothesized to account for lightness perception which each have specific time courses; multiplicative light adaptation (fast, 50 to 200 ms), subtractive light adaptation (fast and slow, up to 30 sec), and simultaneous contrast (instantaneous). Four main experiments were performed. To separate the effect of simultaneous contrast from light adaptation, targets were placed either adjacent to the background (Direct Contrast), or with a 1 degree dark annulus between the target and the background (Annulus); the annulus removes simultaneous contrast cues. Also, the targets were either increments or decrements relative to the background. Thus, the four experiments are Direct Contrast Increment, Direct Contrast Decrement, Annulus Increment, and Annulus Decrement. Results show that simultaneous contrast is the predominant cue for lightness perception in these experiments. A control study comparing Annulus and Direct Contrast conditions for fixed illuminations also suggest strongly the importance of simultaneous contrast. Without simultaneous contrast cues (Annulus), small effects upon lightness perception occur for periods up to 120 sec. These long-term effects most likely correspond to slow adaptation mechanisms (subtractive). No difference was found between increment and decrement targets.},

  abstract = {Functional neuroimaging research has demonstrated that retrieving information about object-associated colors activates the left fusiform gyrus in posterior temporal cortex. Although regions near the fusiform have previously been implicated in color perception, it remains unclear whether color knowledge retrieval actually activates the color perception system. Evidence to this effect would be particularly strong if color perception cortex was activated by color knowledge retrieval triggered strictly with linguistic stimuli. To address this question, subjects performed two tasks while undergoing fMRI. First, subjects performed a property verification task using only words to assess conceptual knowledge. On each trial, subjects verified whether a named color or motor property was true of a named object (e.g., TAXI-yellow, HAIR-combed). Next, subjects performed a color perception task. A region of the left fusiform gyrus that was highly responsive during color perception also showed greater activity for retrieving color than motor property knowledge. These data provide the first evidence for a direct overlap in the neural bases of color perception and stored information about object-associated color, and they significantly add to accumulating evidence that conceptual knowledge is grounded in the brain's modality-specific systems.},

We explore this phenomenon by analyzing the cost function for perceptual error. Our analysis is developed within the mathematical framework of rate\textendash distortion theory. According to our approach, the goal of perception is to minimize the expected cost of error while subject to a strong constraint on the capacity of perceptual processing. We propose that the cost function in color perception is defined by the sum of two components: a metric cost associated with the magnitude of error in color space, and a cost associated with perceptual errors that cross color category boundaries. A computational model embodying this assumption is shown to produce an excellent fit to empirical data. The results generally suggest that what appear as `errors' in working memory performance may reflect reasonable and systematic behaviors in the context of costs.},

  abstract = {Leaf pigment content can provide valuable insight into the physiological performance of leaves. Measurement of spectral reflectance provides a fast, nondestructive method for pigment estimation. A large number of spectral indices have been developed for estimation of leaf pigment content. However, in most cases these indices have been tested for only one or at most a few related species and thus it is not clear whether they can be applied across species with varying leaf structural characteristics. Our objective in this study was to develop spectral indices for prediction of leaf pigment content that are relatively insensitive to species and leaf structure variation and thus could be applied in larger scale remote-sensing studies without extensive calibration. We also quantified the degree of spectral interference between pigments when multiple pigments occur within the same leaf tissue. We found that previously published spectral indices provided relatively poor correlations with leaf chlorophyll content when applied across a wide range of species and plant functional types. Leaf surface reflectance appeared to be the most important factor in this variation. By developing a new spectral index that reduces the effect of differences in leaf surface reflectance, we were able to significantly improve the correlations with chlorophyll content. We also found that an index based on the first derivative of reflectance in the red edge region was insensitive to leaf structural variation. The presence of other pigments did not significantly affect estimation of chlorophyll from spectral reflectance. Previously published carotenoid and anthocyanin indices performed poorly across the whole data set. However, we found that the photochemical reflectance index (PRI, originally developed for estimation of xanthophyll cycle pigment changes) was related to carotenoid/chlorophyll ratios in green leaves. This result has important implications for the interpretation of PRI measured at both large and small scales. Our results demonstrate that spectral indices can be applied across species with widely varying leaf structure without the necessity for extensive calibration for each species. This opens up new possibilities for assessment of vegetation health in heterogeneous natural environments. D 2002 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights reserved.},

To answer this question, we review research on the neural correlates of colour categories, and categorical responses in preverbal infants and non-human animals. With respect to language, the reviewed findings suggest that colour categorisation often involves automatic language processing. At the same time, evidence from non-human animals, infants, and patients with brain lesions indicates that colour categorisation may also occur in the absence of language. Concerning perception, there is little convincing evidence that the bottom-up processes of colour perception are the origin of colour categories. Instead, colour categorisation might simply build upon the continuous colour perception and interact with perception through the direction of attention to colour differences that are relevant to categorisation. We make three suggestions for future research. First, future research in all areas requires methodological improvements, in particular in stimulus control. Second, future research should overcome the universalist-realist debate and go beyond a simple contrast between perception and language. Third, the link between object colours and colour categories provides an alternative approach that might reveal the ecological origin of colour categories. The ecological approach promises establishing evolutionary and developmental continuity between categorical responses in non-human animals, infants and adult humans.},

Retinal signals are processed in the visual cortex through high-level mechanisms that link color perception with top-down expectations and knowledge. Here, we review the neuroimaging evidence about color processing in the brain, and how it is affected by acquired brain lesions in humans. Evidence from patients with brain-damage suggests that high-level color processing may be divided into at least three modules: perceptual color experience, color naming, and color knowledge. These modules appear to be functionally independent but richly interconnected, and serve as cortical relays linking sensory and semantic information, with the final goal of directing object-related behavior. We argue that the relations between colors and their objects are key mechanisms to understand high-level color processing.},

RDS's colour perception, object naming and verbal colour-knowledge (the ability to verbally say the typical colour of an object) were relatively spared. RDS was also able to state if an object was appropriately coloured or not. However, he could neither match colour names to coloured objects, nor match colour patches to grey-scale objects. Thus, RDS's colour-naming deficit was associated with an impaired ability to conceptually relate visually presented object shapes and colours. These results suggest that objects in their typical colour are processed holistically in the visual modality, and that abilities important for colour naming may also be involved in abstracting colours from visual objects. We discuss these findings in the context of developmental psychology and linguistic anthropology, and propose a model of neuro-functional organization of object-colour knowledge.},

  abstract = {The biological basis of the commonality in color lexicons across languages has been hotly debated for decades. Prior evidence that infants categorize color could provide support for the hypothesis that color categorization systems are not purely constructed by communication and culture. Here, we investigate the relationship between infants' categorization of color and the commonality across color lexicons, and the potential biological origin of infant color categories. We systematically mapped infants' categorical recognition memory for hue onto a stimulus array used previously to document the color lexicons of 110 nonindustrialized languages. Following familiarization to a given hue, infants' response to a novel hue indicated that their recognition memory parses the hue continuum into red, yellow, green, blue, and purple categories. Infants' categorical distinctions aligned with common distinctions in color lexicons and are organized around hues that are commonly central to lexical categories across languages. The boundaries between infants' categorical distinctions also aligned, relative to the adaptation point, with the cardinal axes that describe the early stages of color representation in retinogeniculate pathways, indicating that infant color categorization may be partly organized by biological mechanisms of color vision. The findings suggest that color categorization in language and thought is partially biologically constrained and have implications for broader debate on how biology, culture, and communication interact in human cognition.},

In infancy and early childhood, visual input is required to drive visual development (Berardi et al., 2000; Blakemore \& Cooper, 1970; Jand\'o et al., 2012; Knudsen, 2004), but whether or not scene statistics are extracted and represented colour is currently unknown. In adults, visual sensitivity to different hues shows an asymmetry, which relates to the statistical regularity of colour in the natural world (Bosten et al., 2015). We measured colour discrimination in infants to investigate whether or not the visual system can in very early life represent scene statistics.

  abstract = {To what extent are perception and aesthetics shaped by low-level statistical regularities of our visual environments, and on what time scales? We characterized the chromatic statistics of the `visual diets' of people living in remote rainforest and urban environments, by randomly sampling images using calibrated head-mounted cameras as participants went about daily lives. All environments, as is typical for natural scenes, had chromatic distributions with most variance along a roughly blue-yellow axis, but the extent of this bias differed across locations. If color perception and aesthetics are calibrated to the visual environments in which participants are currently immersed, variation in the extent of the bias in scene statistics should have a corresponding impact on perception and aesthetic judgements. To test this, we measured color discrimination and preferences for distributions of color for people living in the different environments. Group differences in the extent of blue-yellow bias in color discrimination were in the opposite direction to that predicted by the differences in scene statistics under an efficient coding framework, but were consistent with perceptual learning in local environments. Preferences for color distributions aligned with scene statistics, but not specifically to local environments, and one group preferred color distributions along an unnatural color axis orthogonal to that dominant in natural scenes.  These preferences could be explained by an interaction of culture and perceptual fluency.  Our study shows the benefits of conducting psychophysics with people at remote locations for understanding the commonalities and diversity in human perception.},

We outline how within just 6 months, infants go from very limited detection of color as newborns to a more sophisticated perception of color that enables them to make sense of objects and the world around them. We summarize the evidence that by 6 months, infants can perceive the dimensions of color and categorize it, and have at least rudimentary mechanisms to keep color perceptually constant despite variation in illumination. In addition, infants' sensitivity to color relates to statistical regularities of color in natural scenes. We illustrate the contribution of these findings to understanding the development of perceptual skills such as discrimination, categorization, and constancy. We also discuss the relevance of the findings for broader questions about perceptual development and identify directions for research.},

  abstract = {Color appearance models are usually based on equations with fixed numerical coefficients that were predetermined to yield optimal agreement for a selected standard observer. Here we address the well-known fact that, among color-normal observers, there are significant differences of cone fundamentals, which often cause observer metamerism. This is not fully addressed by many appearance models. It might seem that observer metamerism could be accurately predicted by substituting an individual's color matching functions into an otherwise-unchanged color appearance model, but this is not assured because the model's coefficients were not designed for the new observer. Here we explore a solution related to how the visual system tends to compensate for changes in color information arising from variations cone fundamentals. For this purpose, we developed a simple color appearance model that uses only a few numerical coefficients, yet accurately predicts the perceptual attributes of Munsell samples under a selected standard lighting condition. We then added a feedback loop to adjust the model coefficients automatically, in response to switching between the cone fundamentals for different observers. This feature is intended to model long term contrast adaptation in the vision system by maintaining the average long-term levels of color contrast. Incorporating this adaptation principle into color appearance models could allow better assessments of displays and illumination systems, to help improve color appearances for most observers.},

  abstract = {The determination of the long-term memory colours of objects has been the subject of investigation for many years. Colour acceptance boundaries have been determined from the visual assessments of objects under variable illumination or by presenting manipulated images of objects on a calibrated computer display. However, a systematic and quantitative rating of the colour of real objects with respect to memory colour is not available at this moment. In this article, nine familiar real objects with colours distributed around the hue circle were positioned in a specially designed LED illumination box. For each object, approximately hundred real illumination spectra were synthesized in a random order keeping the luminance of the object approximately constant. Observers were asked to rate, on a five-point scale, the similarity of the perceived object colour to their idea of what the object looked like in reality. By avoiding specular reflections, the observer was unable to identify any clues as to the colour of the illumination. For each object, similarity ratings showed a good intraobserver and interobserver agreement. The ratings of all the observers were pooled and successfully modeled in IPT colour space by a bivariate Gaussian distribution. It was found that the chromaticity corresponding to the highest rating tended to be shifted toward higher chroma in comparison with the chromaticity calculated under D65 illumination. The bivariate distributions could be very useful in applications where the quantitative evaluation of the colour appearance of an object stimulus is required, such as in the evaluation of the colour rendering capabilities of a light source. \textcopyright{} 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

  abstract = {An important goal in characterizing human color vision is to order color percepts in a way that captures their similarities and differences. This has resulted in the continuing evolution of \&\#x201C;uniform color spaces,\&\#x201D; in which the distances within the space represent the perceptual differences between the stimuli. While these metrics are now very successful in predicting how color percepts are scaled, they do so in largely empirical, ad hoc ways, with limited reference to actual mechanisms of color vision. In this article our aim is to instead begin with general and plausible assumptions about color coding, and then develop a model of color appearance that explicitly incorporates them. We show that many of the features of empirically defined color order systems (those of Munsell, Pantone, NCS, and others) as well as many of the basic phenomena of color perception, emerge naturally from fairly simple principles of color information encoding in the visual system and how it can be optimized for the spectral characteristics of the environment.},

  abstract = {The CIE color rendering (fidelity) index (CRI) has remained unchanged for over four decades. Most, if not all, of its components could be updated to more state-of-the-art methods. One of the most critical components of any color rendering (fidelity) metric is the test sample selection. This article therefore addresses the importance of uniform sampling of wavelength space to avoid selective optimization\textemdash that is, taking advantage of the unequal contributions of different wavelength regions to the general color rendering score\textemdash of light source spectral power distributions. It summarizes the development of a mathematical sample set with undistorted spectral sensitivity, the HL17 set. The set is used in a recently proposed update, the CRI2012 general color rendering index. To assess the impact of the spectrally uniform sample set on color fidelity scores, the CRI2012 index values for each of a set of 139 lamps were compared with those of the CIE CRI. In addition, the impact of updating the other components was investigated. A mean and maximum absolute difference of respectively 5.9 and 21.8 index units were found between the CRI2012 and CIE CRI, although the largest part\textemdash respectively 4.03 and 19.7 index units\textemdash was shown to be the result of updating the color difference engine and the switch to the CIE 10\textdegree{} observer. The analysis also indicated possible past spectral selective optimization of some warm-white tri-band fluorescent sources for high luminous efficacy of radiation (LER) and (just) sufficient CIE Ra values by taking advantage of the spectral nonuniformity of the CIE reflectance set. Adopting a spectrally uniform sample set in a color rendering metric therefore has important practical implications when designing light source spectra. Finally, possible updates and further improvements of the CRI2012 are briefly mentioned.},

  abstract = {Recently, a group including the present authors developed a new color rendering (fidelity) measure, approved by the IES and henceforth referred to as IES Rf, that has two major updates with respect to the general color rendering index Ra of the CIE. First, it proposes an update to the more perceptually uniform CAM02-UCS color space. Secondly, instead of using only a small number (eight) of moderately saturated samples to determine a general color fidelity index, the IES method proposes using a set of 99 samples uniformly distributed in color space. In addition to the latter, the sample set has one other important property: spectral uniformity. This ensures that the sample set is not wavelength biased: all wavelengths contribute equivalently to the general color fidelity score. This article explores the importance of these two updates for color fidelity evaluation. It shows how the color space update results in a substantial spread of the new color fidelity scores relative to the old CIE Ra values and how the sample set update results in an overall reduction of color fidelity scores for most light source spectra with high CIE Ra ({$\geq$}80) and high luminous efficacy of radiation (LER) values, especially those with narrowband or spiked spectral features. It is shown that calculated color fidelity scores are affected by the degree of sample set spectral uniformity and that, in the absence of sample set spectral uniformity, light source spectra can be tuned to yield anomalously high CIE Ra values without necessarily yielding an increase in actual perceived color fidelity.},

Two factors are emphasized: First, the fine stimulus control that is required to isolate putative visual mechanisms and second, the relationship between physiological data and psychophysical approaches. We review convergent findings from physiology and psychophysics with respect to asymmetries in the retinal wiring of S-ON and S-OFF visual pathways, and the associated treatment of increments and decrements in the S-cone system. Beyond the retina, we consider the lack of S-cone projections to superior colliculus and the use of S-cone stimuli in experimental psychology, for example to address questions about the mechanisms of visually driven attention. Careful selection of stimulus parameters enables psychophysicists to produce entirely reversible, temporary, ``lesions,'' and to assess behavior in the absence of specific neural subsystems.},

In spite of these changes, the objects within a scene tend to remain constant in their apparent colour. We start this review by discussing the psychophysical procedures that have been used to quantify colour constancy. The transformation imposed on the visual signals by a change in illumination dictates what the visual system must `undo' to achieve constancy. The problem is mathematically underdetermined, and can be solved only by exploiting regularities of the visual world. The last decade has seen a substantial increase in our knowledge of such regularities as technical advances have made it possible to make empirical measurements of large numbers of environmental scenes and illuminants. This review provides a taxonomy of models of human colour constancy based first on the assumptions they make about how the inverse transformation might be simplified, and second, on how the parameters of the inverse transformation might be set by elements of a complex scene. Candidate algorithms for human colour constancy are represented graphically and pictorially, and the availability and utility of an accurate estimate of the illuminant is discussed. Throughout this review, we consider both the information that is, in principle, available and empirical assessments of what information the visual system actually uses. In the final section we discuss where in our visual systems these computations might be implemented.},

Effects of illuminance on the subjective measures, as well as those on heart rate were not dependent on time of day or duration of exposure. Performance effects were most pronounced in the morning sessions and towards the end of the one-hour exposure period. The effect on heart rate variability was also most pronounced at the end of the one-hour exposure.

In lateral eyes of vertebrates, light hyperpolarizes rod and cone photoreceptors that synapse onto bipolar and horizontal cells in the first synaptic layer of the retina. The sign of the photoreceptor signal is either conserved or inverted in bipolar cells, resulting in chromatically dependent depolarizing and hyperpolarizing responses to visual stimuli. Visual information is then conveyed to the second synaptic layer for encoding and transmission to the brain by ganglion cells. The parietal (third) eye of lizards does not contain bipolar cells or other interneurons. Photoreceptors synapse directly onto ganglion cells1\textendash 4 and yet, even in the absence of interneurons, antagonistic chromatic mechanisms modulate the ganglion cell responses5,6. We report here that chromatic antagonism in the third eye originates in the chromatically dependent hyperpolarizing and depolarizing response of the photoreceptors to light.

  abstract = {Some fundamental principles of colour vision, deduced from perceptual studies, have been understood for a long time. Physiological studies have confirmed the existence of three classes of cone photoreceptors, and of colour-opponent neurons that compare the signals from cones, but modern work has drawn attention to unexpected complexities of early organization: the proportions of cones of different types vary widely among individuals, without great effect on colour vision; the arrangement of different types of cones in the mosaic seems to be random, making it hard to optimize the connections to colour-opponent mechanisms; and new forms of colour-opponent mechanisms have recently been discovered. At a higher level, in the primary visual cortex, recent studies have revealed a simpler organization than had earlier been supposed, and in some respects have made it easier to reconcile physiological and perceptual findings.},

  abstract = {Melanopsin ganglion cells have defied convention since their discovery almost 20 years ago. In the years following, many types of these intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells (ipRGCs) have emerged. In the mouse retina, there are currently six known types (M1\textendash M6) of melanopsin ganglion cells, each with unique morphology, mosaics, connections, physiology, projections, and functions. While melanopsin-expressing cells are usually associated with behaviors like circadian photoentrainment and the pupillary light reflex, the characterization of multiple types has demonstrated a reach that may extend far beyond non-image-forming vision. In fact, studies have shown that individual types of melanopsin ganglion cells have the potential to impact image-forming functions like contrast sensitivity and color opponency. Thus, the goal of this review is to summarize the morphological and functional aspects of the six known types of melanopsin ganglion cells in the mouse retina and to highlight their respective roles in non-image-forming and image-forming vision. Although many melanopsin ganglion cell types do project to image-forming brain targets, it is important to note that this is only the first step in determining their influence on image-forming vision. Even so, the visual system has canonically been divided into these two functional realms and melanopsin ganglion cells have begun to challenge the boundary between them, providing an overlap of visual information that is complementary rather than redundant. Further studies on these ganglion cell photoreceptors will no doubt continue to illustrate an ever-expanding role for melanopsin ganglion cells in image-forming vision.},

  abstract = {Melanopsin is expressed in distinct types of intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells (ipRGCs), which drive behaviors from circadian photoentrainment to contrast detection. A major unanswered question is how the same photopigment, melanopsin, influences such vastly different functions. Here we show that melanopsin's role in contrast detection begins in the retina, via direct effects on M4 ipRGC (ON alpha RGC) signaling. This influence persists across an unexpectedly wide range of environmental light levels ranging from starlight to sunlight, which considerably expands the functional reach of melanopsin on visual processing. Moreover, melanopsin increases the excitability of M4 ipRGCs via closure of potassium leak channels, a previously unidentified~target of the melanopsin phototransduction cascade. Strikingly, this mechanism is selective for image-forming circuits, as M1 ipRGCs (involved in non-image forming behaviors), exhibit a melanopsin-mediated decrease in excitability. Thus, melanopsin signaling is repurposed by ipRGC subtypes to shape distinct visual behaviors.},

  abstract = {Retinal ganglion cells that release GABA Retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) communicate light signals from the retina to the brain and were previously considered to signal exclusively through release of excitatory neurotransmitters. There have been earlier hints of RGCs producing the inhibitory neurotransmitter {$\gamma$}-aminobutyric acid (GABA), but the specific cells have never been identified and their function was entirely unknown. Sonoda et al. found that a subpopulation of intrinsically photosensitive RGCs (ipRGCs) releases GABA (see the Perspective by Ding and Wei). Removal of GABA signaling from ipRGCs led to an increased light sensitivity of the pupillary light reflex and of circadian photoentrainment. GABA release thus moved the dynamic range of these non\textendash image-forming behaviors to bright light intensities. These results explain why these behaviors are so much less sensitive to environmental lighting conditions than conscious visual perception. Science, this issue p. 527; see also p. 471 Retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) drive diverse, light-evoked behaviors that range from conscious visual perception to subconscious, non\textendash image-forming behaviors. It is thought that RGCs primarily drive these functions through the release of the excitatory neurotransmitter glutamate. We identified a subset of melanopsin-expressing intrinsically photosensitive RGCs (ipRGCs) in mice that release the inhibitory neurotransmitter {$\gamma$}-aminobutyric acid (GABA) at non\textendash image-forming brain targets. GABA release from ipRGCs dampened the sensitivity of both the pupillary light reflex and circadian photoentrainment, thereby shifting the dynamic range of these behaviors to higher light levels. Our results identify an inhibitory RGC population in the retina and provide a circuit-level mechanism that contributes to the relative insensitivity of non\textendash image-forming behaviors at low light levels. An eye\textendash brain circuit modulates the sensitivity of non\textendash image-forming behaviors such as pupillary light reflex and circadian photoentrainment.

  abstract = {The idea that color appearance is a unitary experience is central to contemporary accounts of color. I test this idea using measurements of the shift in appearance between a bluish and a yellowish viewing context. My experiments took place within a naturalistic experimental room that contained real surfaces illuminated by computer-controlled lights and a projection colorimeter. Observers indicated appearance using asymmetric matching when the contexts were presented spatially and simultaneously. Observers also indicated appearance by naming the color category to which a stimulus belonged, by adjusting stimuli to appear achromatic, and by numerically scaling appearance. In these tasks the contexts were presented successively. I evaluate the agreement across tasks by fitting models to the appearance shifts. For each task, the shift in appearance was consistent with a model in which gains on cone-specific channels were affected by the viewing context. The shifts were in reasonable agreement across tasks for three observers. This indicates that the effects of context on color appearance are largely independent of the task used to assess appearance. Of the four tasks, asymmetric matching provided the most precise determination of the context-dependent model parameters.},

Furthermore, because the pattern of performance was similar at all exposure durations, and because form and color are processed in different areas of cortex, the results imply that color must be bound as an integral part of the representation at the earliest stages of processing.},

While the former is a well-studied factor in synchronizing behavior and physiology to the earth's 24-hour rotation, color sensitivity in the regulation of circadian rhythms has not been systematically studied. Drawing on the concept of color opponency, a well-known property of image-forming vision in many vertebrates (including humans), we consider how the spectral shifts during twilight are encoded by a color-opponent sensory system for non-image-forming (NIF) visual functions including phase shifting and melatonin suppression. We review electrophysiological evidence for color sensitivity in the pineal/parietal organs of fish, amphibians and reptiles, color coding in neurons in the circadian pacemaker in mice as well as sporadic evidence for color sensitivity in NIF visual functions in birds and other mammals. Together, these studies suggest that color opponency in may be an important modulator of light-driven physiological and behavioral responses.},

  abstract = {Signals from cones are recombined in postreceptoral channels [luminance, L + M; red-green, L - M; blue-yellow, S - (L + M)]. The melanopsin-containing retinal ganglion cells are also active at daytime light levels and recent psychophysical results suggest that melanopsin contributes to conscious vision in humans. Here, we measured BOLD fMRI responses to spectral modulations that separately targeted the postreceptoral cone channels and melanopsin. Responses to spatially uniform (27.5\textdegree{} field size, central 5\textdegree{} obscured) flicker at 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, and 64 Hz were recorded from areas V1, V2/V3, motion-sensitive area MT, and the lateral occipital complex. In V1 and V2/V3, higher temporal sensitivity was observed to L + M + S (16 Hz) compared with L - M flicker (8 Hz), consistent with psychophysical findings. Area MT was most sensitive to rapid (32 Hz) flicker of either L + M + S or L - M. We found S cone responses only in areas V1 and V2/V3 (peak frequency: 4\textendash 8 Hz). In addition, we studied an L + M modulation and found responses that were effectively identical at all temporal frequencies to those recorded for the L + M + S modulation. Finally, we measured the cortical response to melanopsin-directed flicker and compared this response with control modulations that addressed stimulus imprecision and the possibility of stimulation of cones in the shadow of retinal blood vessels (penumbral cones). For our stimulus conditions, melanopsin flicker did not elicit a cortical response exceeding that of the control modulations. We note that failure to control for penumbral cone stimulation could be mistaken for a melanopsin response. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT The retina contains cone photoreceptors and ganglion cells that contain the photopigment melanopsin. Cones provide brightness and color signals to visual cortex. Melanopsin influences circadian rhythm and the pupil, but its contribution to cortex and perception is less clear. We measured the response of human visual cortex with fMRI using spectral modulations tailored to stimulate the cones and melanopsin separately. We found that cortical responses to cone signals vary systematically across visual areas. Differences in temporal sensitivity for achromatic, red-green, and blue-yellow stimuli generally reflect the known perceptual properties of vision. We found that melanopsin signals do not produce a measurable response in visual cortex at temporal frequencies between 0.5 and 64 Hz at daytime light levels.},

Much is known about the brain pathways of signals originating from cones. Considerably less is known about the projections of the ipRGCs, in particular in the human brain. Here we used BOLD fMRI to measure neural responses in humans to spectral modulations that selectively target melanopsin while minimizing the responses of the cones, and compare these to responses generated using cone-targeted spectral modulations. Methods: Four observers viewed large-field (27.5\textdegree{} diameter, central 5\textdegree{} obscured) sinusoidal flicker (1-16 Hz, log spaced) at 470 cd/m2 during BOLD fMRI. Using the method of silent substitution and a digital light synthesizer, spectral modulations were directed at melanopsin, L+M, L-M, or S cones. An isochromatic modulation (L+M+S+melanopsin) was also studied. Estimates of photopigment spectral sensitivities used to produce modulations accounted for observer age and stimulus extent. Anatomical regions of interest were defined for the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN; using volumetric templates), for primary visual cortex (V1) and for extrastriate areas (V2, V3 and hV4) (Benson VSS2013). Cortical voxels were restricted to {$>$}5\textdegree{} eccentricity as an extra precaution against contamination from changes in cone spectral sensitivity at the fovea. Temporal transfer functions (TTFs), describing the BOLD response as a function of temporal frequency for each modulation direction, were averaged for the four observers. Results: We found robust melanopsin-driven responses in both LGN and V1-hV4. In LGN, the melanopsin response was bandpass, maximal at 8 Hz with no measurable response below 2 Hz. The melanopsin response in V1 and V2 through hV4 was also bandpass. Across areas the responses to cone-directed stimuli differed with the direction of the spectral modulation, and differed as well from the responses to melanopsin stimulation. S-cone responses were distinct from melanopsin responses in both LGN and cortex. Conclusions: Signals originating in the melanopsin-containing ipRGCs produce robust responses in the LGN and visual cortex of the human brain. The TTFs for melanopsin-driven responses are bandpass in both LGN and visual cortex. The responses tomelanopsin-driven stimulation have a temporal signature distinct from that of cone-driven responses.},

These photoreceptor classes have distinct but overlapping spectral tuning, and even a monochromatic light with a wavelength matched to the peak spectral sensitivity of a given photoreceptor will stimulate all photoreceptors. The method of silent substitution uses pairs of lights to selectively stimulate a given class of photoreceptors while keeping the activation of all others constant.

Signals from cones are combined both additively and in opposition to create the perception of overall light and color. Similar mechanisms seem to be at work in the control of the pupil's response to light. Uncharacterized however, is the relative contribution of melanopsin and S cones, with their overlapping, short-wavelength spectral sensitivities. We measured the response of the human pupil to the separate stimulation of the cones and melanopsin at a range of temporal frequencies under photopic conditions. The S-cone and melanopsin photoreceptor channels were found to be low-pass, in contrast to a band-pass response of the pupil to L- and M-cone signals. An examination of the phase relationships of the evoked responses revealed that melanopsin signals add with signals from L and M cones but are opposed by signals from S cones in control of the pupil. The opposition of the S cones is revealed in a seemingly paradoxical dilation of the pupil to greater S-cone photon capture. This surprising result is explained by the neurophysiological properties of ipRGCs found in animal studies.},

  abstract = {In 1819, Johann Purkinje described how a moving light source that displaces the shadow of the retinal blood vessels to adjacent cones can produce the entopic percept of a branching tree. Here, we describe a novel method for producing a similar percept. We used a device that mixes 56 narrowband primaries under computer control, in conjunction with the method of silent substitution, to present observers with a spectral modulation that selectively targeted penumbral cones in the shadow of the retinal blood vessels. Such a modulation elicits a clear Purkinje-tree percept. We show that the percept is specific to penumbral L and M cone stimulation and is not produced by selective penumbral S cone stimulation. The Purkinje-tree percept was strongest at 16 Hz and fell off at lower (8 Hz) and higher (32 Hz) temporal frequencies. Selective stimulation of open-field cones that are not in shadow, with penumbral cones silenced, also produced the percept, but it was not seen when penumbral and open-field cones were modulated together. This indicates the need for spatial contrast between penumbral and open-field cones to create the Purkinje-tree percept. Our observation provides a new means for studying the response of retinally stabilized images and demonstrates that penumbral cones can support spatial vision. Further, the result illustrates a way in which silent substitution techniques can fail to be silent. We show that inadvertent penumbral cone stimulation can accompany melanopsin-directed modulations that are designed only to silence open-field cones. This in turn can result in visual responses that might be mistaken as melanopsin-driven.},

This biological model succeeds in automatically correcting the color of images to a `human vision appearance' (as is commonly required in cameras), as opposed to many CC algorithms better suited for machine vision applications such as color object identification. The algorithm is based on retinal mechanisms of adaptation (gain control): `local' and `remote'. These mechanisms enable video image applications, since they take into account the dynamics of human adaptation mechanisms. The results indicate that the contribution of adaptation mechanisms to CC is significant, robust, and succeeds in performing color correction of still images and video sequences under single and multiple illumination conditions.},

Serial electron microscopic reconstructions revealed that M5 cells receive selective UV-opsin drive from Type 9 cone bipolar cells but also mixed cone signals from bipolar Types 6, 7, and 8. Recordings suggest that both excitation and inhibition are driven by the ON channel and that chromatic opponency results from M-cone-driven surround inhibition mediated by wide-field spiking GABAergic amacrine cells. We show that M5 cells send axons to the dLGN and are thus positioned to provide chromatic signals to visual cortex. These findings underscore that melanopsin's influence extends beyond unconscious reflex functions to encompass cortical vision, perhaps including the perception of color.},

Metamerism can be avoided by selecting modern substitutes with similar spectral reflectance curves to the traditional pigments. It is shown that manganese blue is the most suitable modern pigment for matching azurite and French ultramarine for matching genuine ultramarine, and that it is inadvisable to try matching Prussian blue with French ultramarine, cobalt blue or cerulean blue.

Using the learned categories, we modeled fMRI brain signals evoked in human subjects when viewing images of scenes.~We find that evoked activity across much of anterior visual cortex is explained by the learned categories. Furthermore, a decoder based on these scene categories accurately predicts the categories and objects comprising novel scenes from brain activity evoked by those scenes. These results suggest that the human brain represents scene categories that capture the co-occurrence statistics of objects in the world.},

Psychophysical linking hypotheses predict an explicit neural representation of unique hues at some stage of the visual system, but no such representation has been described [8]. The special status of the unique hues ``remains one of the central mysteries of color science'' [9]. Here we report that a population of recently identified cells in posterior inferior temporal cortex of macaque monkey contains an explicit representation of unique hues.},

  abstract = {Chromatic mechanisms have been studied extensively with psychophysical techniques in humans, but the number and nature of the mechanisms are still controversial. Appeals to monkey neurophysiology are often used to sort out the competing claims and to test hypotheses arising from the experiments in humans, but psychophysical chromatic mechanisms have never been assessed in monkeys. Here we address this issue by measuring color-detection thresholds in monkeys before and after chromatic adaptation, employing a standard approach used to determine chromatic mechanisms in humans. We conducted separate experiments using adaptation configured as either flickering full-field colors or heterochromatic gratings. Full-field colors would favor activity within the visual system at or before the arrival of retinal signals to V1, before the spatial transformation of color signals by the cortex. Conversely, gratings would favor activity within the cortex where neurons are often sensitive to spatial chromatic structure. Detection thresholds were selectively elevated for the colors of full-field adaptation when it modulated along either of the two cardinal chromatic axes that define cone-opponent color space [L vs M or S vs (L + M)], providing evidence for two privileged cardinal chromatic mechanisms implemented early in the visual-processing hierarchy. Adaptation with gratings produced elevated thresholds for colors of the adaptation regardless of its chromatic makeup, suggesting a cortical representation comprised of multiple higher-order mechanisms each selective for a different direction in color space. The results suggest that color is represented by two cardinal channels early in the processing hierarchy and many chromatic channels in brain regions closer to perceptual readout.},

  abstract = {An open issue of retinal organization and function is the comprehension of the different tasks specifically performed by bipolar cells, the neurons that collect information from photoreceptors in the outer retina and convey the signal to the inner plexiform layer. Particularly interesting is to understand the unique contribution to the visual signal brought by cone bipolar cells, neurons typical of the mammalian retina and especially dedicated to receive synaptic input from cones. In all the species studied so far, it has been shown that cone bipolar cells occur in about ten different types, which form distinct clusters identified with a panel of both classical and modern genetic methods. Reviewed here is current literature illustrating the occurrence of morphological, molecular and architectural features that confer to each bipolar cell type exclusive fingerprints, ultimately predicting the emergence of similarly unique, albeit still partially unraveled, functional properties. Thus, differences among cone bipolar cells lay the ground for the genesis in the outer retina of parallel channels, which convey to the inner retina separate information, among others, about contrast, chromatic features and temporal properties of the visual signal.},

  abstract = {This contribution critically examines various concepts related to damage functions in current use; it does not represent a comprehensive review, however. In heritage science, damage functions can be defined as functions of unacceptable change, dependent on agents of change. Unlike in other domains of science, the reference to unacceptable change implies that a value-based decision needs to be applied to the analytically determinable change, or dose\textendash response function. Since there are a number of values associated with heritage, there can be a number of damage functions describing one and the same physical or chemical process of change. For practical reasons, it is thus useful to decouple the value function from the dose\textendash response function, as the latter can be independently deduced (empirically or experimentally). While the behaviour of single materials and objects is often modelled deterministically, the probabilistic approach can be used to describe the degradation of complex structures, e.g. buildings, although not commonly in heritage research. There is a case to be made for more in-depth exploration of incremental and stochastic processes of degradation of heritage materials and structures, and the associated values, with a view towards developing more damage functions. Damage functions find use in modelling for predictive maintenance. However, predictions are associated with uncertainty due to the need for extrapolation, and this is also rarely analytically examined. Validation of modelling processes is possible using accurate methodologies of asset monitoring, which would enable an effective appraisal of preservation strategies.},

Chromatic sensitivity (in cone contrast coordinates) is about 7 times higher than luminance sensitivity in the fovea but falls faster with eccentricity, so that luminance and chromatic sensitivities are similar at eccentricities of 20\textdegree{} or less. At eccentricities greater than about 14\textdegree, there is a clear asymmetry wherein green chromatic flashes are considerably less detectable than red ones. By measuring complete detection contours for many ratios of incremental and decremental red and green flashes, we isolated the red and green chromatic detection mechanisms, and demonstrated that the red-green asymmetry is not a property of the L- or M-cone response per se, but rather is a property of the post-receptoral, chromatic mechanisms. The peripheral luminance and chromatic mechanisms could be further separated with a suprathreshold luminance flash (a pedestal), since an intense pedestal masks coincident luminance test flashes but facilitates the chromatic flashes. The luminance pedestal approximately linearizes the chromatic detection function (the psychometric function).},

Thresholds were plotted in normalized coordinates in which the quantal change in the M and L cones due to the flash was divided by the quantal catch due to the field. Detection contours for a wide range of test flashes provide evidence for luminance and chromatic mechanisms that respectively respond to the sum and difference of the M and L cone signals. Field color has little influence on the luminance mechanism but strongly affects chromatic detection, with sensitivity being maximal on yellow fields and declining slightly on green fields and declining strongly on red fields. Similar effects were obtained for long (200 msec) and very brief flashes, although the shape of the contours differed considerably. The results provide evidence for a second adaptation site within the red-green chromatic pathways, similar to the second-site in the S cone pathways. Chromatic fields (green and red) polarize the site and reduce sensitivity to chromatic flashes.},

Moreover, the triplets of cone pigments in different catarrhines (Old World apes and monkeys) are strikingly similar in their spectral positions. We ask whether the selective advantage of trichromacy lies in an enhanced ability to find edible leaves or fruit. Further, we ask whether any factor in these two search tasks has constrained the particular set of cone spectral sensitivities observed in all catarrhines. We measured the spectral properties of the natural environments of six primate species in Uganda: Pan troglodytes, Cercopithecus mitis, Cercopithecus ascanius, Lophocebus albigena, Colobus guereza and Colobus badius. We concentrated on the fruit and leaves in their diets and the leaves of the trees that make up the background against which these diet items must be found. We plotted these measured stimuli in colour spaces appropriate for each primate species, and found that both frugivory and folivory are facilitated by the extra dimension of colour vision found in catarrhines but lacking in most other mammals. Furthermore, by treating the task of searching for food as a signal-detection task, we show that, of all possible combinations of cone sensitivities, the spectral positions of the actual primate pigments are optimal for finding fruit or young leaves against the background of mature leaves. This is because the variance of the chromaticities of the mature leaves is minimised in one channel of the primate's colour vision, so allowing anything that is not a mature leaf to stand out.},

  abstract = {We present a quantitative means of assessing the conspicuousness of animal coats or other objects in terms of the color vision of each possible observer. We measured reflectance spectra from the fur and skin of many primate species in order to provide an objective survey of the possibilities of pelage coloration found in extant primates. We show that the orange coloration displayed by many platyrrhine and some strepsirhine primates, while being conspicuous to humans, would be cryptic amongst foliage to all males and many females of their own species. In relation to this finding, we briefly review what is known of the color vision of birds that prey on primates, and assess how conspicuous the orange pelage would be to these predators. Am. J.

  abstract = {In light of its capacity for remote physiological assessment over a wide range of anatomical locations, imaging photoplethysmography has become an attractive research area in biomedical and clinical community. Amongst recent iPPG studies, two separate research directions have been revealed, i.e., scientific camera based imaging PPG (iPPG) and webcam based imaging PPG (wPPG). Little is known about the difference between these two techniques. To address this issue, a dual-channel imaging PPG system (iPPG and wPPG) using ambient light as the illumination source has been introduced in this study. The performance of the two imaging PPG techniques was evaluated through the measurement of cardiac pulse acquired from the face of 10 male subjects before and after 10 min of cycling exercise. A time-frequency representation method was used to visualize the time-dependent behaviour of the heart rate. In comparison to the gold standard contact PPG, both imaging PPG techniques exhibit comparable functional characteristics in the context of cardiac pulse assessment. Moreover, the synchronized ambient light intensity recordings in the present study can provide additional information for appraising the performance of the imaging PPG systems. This feasibility study thereby leads to a new route for non-contact monitoring of vital signs, with clear applications in triage and homecare.},

  abstract = {The specificity of cone inputs to ganglion cells has implications for the development of retinal connections and the nature of information transmitted to higher areas of the brain. We introduce a rapid and precise method for measuring signs and magnitudes of cone inputs to visual neurons. Colors of stimuli are modulated around circumferences of three color planes in clockwise and counterclockwise directions. For each neuron, the projection of the preferred vector in each plane was estimated by averaging the response phases to clockwise and counterclockwise modulation. The signs and weights of cone inputs were derived directly from the preferred vectors. The efficiency of the method enables us to measure cone inputs at different temporal frequencies and short-wavelength-sensitive (S) cone adaptation levels. The results show that S-cone inputs to the parvocellular and magnocellular ganglion cells are negligible, which implies underlying connectional specificity in the retinal circuitry.},

Primate colour vision is traditionally believed to have evolved for finding food in the forest. Recent work has tested the ecological importance of trichromacy to primates, both by measuring the spectral and chemical properties of food eaten in the wild, and by testing the relative foraging abilities of dichromatic and trichromatic primates. Molecular studies have revealed the genetic mechanisms of the evolution of trichromacy, and are providing new insight into visual pigment gene expression and colour vision defects. By drawing together work from these different fields, we can gain a better understanding of how natural selection has shaped the evolution of trichromatic colour vision in primates and also about mechanisms of gene duplication, heterozygote advantage and balancing selection.},

The main aspects of the research were to elaborate the optimal LED spectral power distribution for the lighting of different colour textiles, fruits and vegetables, meat and bakery products. The spectrum was tailored towards different colour quality metrics such as the colour rendering index and the colour quality scale. Small scale investigations with eye-tracker studies were carried out by Osram Opto Semiconductors at the University of Regensburg and full scale experiments were conducted at the University of Pannonia during the project in order to determine which metric correlates best to the preference of the observers. Results of the psychophysical have been evaluated with the help of analytic hierarchy process and a modified Thurstone method. As a result of the investigation, optimal spectral power distributions for shop environment are described.},

The question investigated in this chapter is whether there is a substantial colour difference between the digital reproductions of the artefacts downloaded from several online databases and the original works. Tests and measurements aimed to explore the reasons for the differences, which were detected and are described. Six paintings were selected for detailed investigation. Representative coloured patches were measured on these reproductions from the internet, displaying them in three popular web browsers, and the data sets were compared. Results from this research demonstrate that there are significant differences between the original artefacts and their digital reproductions, and there is a significant difference between the different web browsers. The source of this difference is very complex. One is the difference between the displaying techniques of the various web browsers, which produces a relevant aberration in colour rendering. This consequence can arise from the JPEG encoding and decoding methods. Implicit use of colour spaces in browsers, missing or incorrect EXIF data, and noncalibrated displays together can result in very different forms of colour representation.},

  abstract = {Prolonged viewing of a chromatically modulated stimulus usually leads to changes in its appearance, and that of similar stimuli. These aftereffects of habituation have been thought to reflect the activity of two populations of neurons in visual cortex that have particular importance in color vision, one sensitive to red\textendash green modulation, the other to blue\textendash yellow, but they have not been identified. We show here, in recordings from macaque primary visual cortex (V1), that prolonged exposure to chromatic modulation reveals two fundamental mechanisms with distinctive chromatic signatures that match those of the mechanisms identified by perceptual observations. In nearly all neurons, these mechanisms contribute to both excitation and to regulatory gain controls, and as a result their habituation can have paradoxical effects on response. The mechanisms must be located near the input layers of V1, before their distinct chromatic signatures diffuse. Our observations suggest that the fundamental mechanisms do not give rise to two distinct L\textendash M and S chromatic pathways. Rather, the mechanisms are better understood as stages in the elaboration of chromatic tuning, expressed in varying proportions in all cells in V1 (and beyond), and made accessible to physiological and perceptual investigation only through habituation.},

  abstract = {Categorical perception is a ubiquitous function in sensory information processing and is reported to have important influences on the recognition of presented and/or memorized stimuli. However, such complex interactions among categorical perception and other aspects of sensory processing have not been explained well in a unified manner. Here, we propose a recurrent neural network model to process categorical information of stimuli, which approximately realizes a hierarchical Bayesian estimation on stimuli. The model accounts for a wide variety of neurophysiological and cognitive phenomena in a consistent framework. In particular, the reported complexity of categorical effects, including (i) task-dependent modulation of neural response, (ii) clustering of neural population representation, (iii) temporal evolution of perceptual color memory and (iv) a non-uniform discrimination threshold, are explained as different aspects of a single model. Moreover, we directly examine key model behaviors in the monkey visual cortex by analyzing neural population dynamics during categorization and discrimination of color stimuli. We find that the categorical task causes temporally-evolving biases in the neuronal population representations toward the focal colors, which supports the proposed model. These results suggest that categorical perception can be achieved by recurrent neural dynamics that approximates optimal probabilistic inference in the changing environment.},

Here, we report a line of evidence that flexibly modulated attractor dynamics during task switching are already present in the higher visual cortex in macaque monkeys. With a nonlinear decoding approach, we can extract the particular aspect of the neural population response that reflects the task-induced emergence of bistable attractor dynamics in a neural population, which could be obscured by standard unsupervised dimensionality reductions such as PCA. The dynamical modulation selectively increases the information relevant to task demands, indicating that such modulation is beneficial for perceptual decisions. A computational model that features nonlinear recurrent interaction among neurons with a task-dependent background input replicates the key properties observed in the experimental data. These results suggest that the context-dependent attractor dynamics involving the sensory cortex can underlie flexible perceptual abilities.},

Fourteen sound and healthy female subjects (22\textendash 27 years of age) participated in the experiments. Each subject was told to keep a relaxed seating posture with no physical restriction. At the same time, heart rate was measured by a pulse oximeter and respiratory rate was measured by a thermistor placed at the external naris. Using AR spectral analysis, two clear peaks could be detected at approximately 0.3 and 1.2 Hz. The peaks were thought to correspond to the respiratory rate and the heart rate. Correlation coefficients of 0.90 and 0.93 were obtained for the measurement of heart rate and respiratory rate, respectively.},

We compute the melanopsin response for different times of the day as well make a comparison of the effect of seasonal changes. We optimise a mixedcolor LED lighting system for high melanopic-lux in addition to high Colour Rendering Index and Luminous Efficacy. These findings have important implications for future lighting architectural design for maintaining alertness and improving the wellbeing of humans.},

  abstract = {Visual area V4 in the macaque monkey is a cortical area that is strongly involved in color and shape perception. However, fundamental questions about V4 are still debated. V4 was initially characterized as a color-processing area, but subsequent studies revealed that it contains a diverse complement of cells, including those with preference for color, orientation, disparity and higher-order feature preferences. This has led to disputes and uncertainty about the role of V4 in vision. Using intrinsic signal optical imaging methods in awake, behaving monkeys, we found that different feature preferences are functionally organized in V4. Optical images revealed that regions with preferential response to color were largely separate from orientation-selective regions. Our results help to resolve long-standing controversies regarding functional diversity and retinotopy in V4 and indicate the presence of spatially biased distribution of featural representation in V4 in the ventral visual pathway.},

  abstract = {Remote sensing of the reflectance photoplethysmogram using a video camera typically positioned 1~m away from the patient's face is a promising method for monitoring the vital signs of patients without attaching any electrodes or sensors to them. Most of the papers in the literature on non-contact vital sign monitoring report results on human volunteers in controlled environments. We have been able to obtain estimates of heart rate and respiratory rate and preliminary results on changes in oxygen saturation from double-monitored patients undergoing haemodialysis in the Oxford Kidney Unit. To achieve this, we have devised a novel method of cancelling out aliased frequency components caused by artificial light flicker, using auto-regressive (AR) modelling and pole cancellation. Secondly, we have been able to construct accurate maps of the spatial distribution of heart rate and respiratory rate information from the coefficients of the AR model. In stable sections with minimal patient motion, the mean absolute error between the camera-derived estimate of heart rate and the reference value from a pulse oximeter is similar to the mean absolute error between two pulse oximeter measurements at different sites (finger and earlobe). The activities of daily living affect the respiratory rate, but the camera-derived estimates of this parameter are at least as accurate as those derived from a thoracic expansion sensor (chest belt). During a period of obstructive sleep apnoea, we tracked changes in oxygen saturation using the ratio of normalized reflectance changes in two colour channels (red and blue), but this required calibration against the reference data from a pulse oximeter.},

  abstract = {Shepard has argued that a universal law should govern generalization across different domains of perception and cognition, as well as across organisms from different species or even different planets. Starting with some basic assumptions about natural kinds, he derived an exponential decay function as the form of the universal generalization gradient, which accords strikingly well with a wide range of empirical data. However, his original formulation applied only to the ideal case of generalization from a single encountered stimulus to a single novel stimulus, and for stimuli that can be represented as points in a continuous metric psychological space. Here we recast Shepard's theory in a more general Bayesian framework and show how this naturally extends his approach to the more realistic situation of generalizing from multiple consequential stimuli with arbitrary representational structure. Our framework also subsumes a version of Tversky's set-theoretic model of similarity, which is conventionally thought of as the primary alternative to Shepard's continuous metric space model of similarity and generalization. This unification allows us not only to draw deep parallels between the set-theoretic and spatial approaches, but also to significantly advance the explanatory power of set-theoretic models.},

  abstract = {The CIE general colour rendering index (Ra) is still the only widely used and accepted colour fidelity index for characterising white light sources. However, user preference for light sources is not determined by fidelity alone but also by colour saturation. Here, we investigate the impact of fidelity and gamut area on the preference for white light sources in three application areas: fresh food, packaged food and skin tones. Thirty-four participants evaluated the attractiveness of object appearance for seven light sources with Ra values ranging between 70 and 100 and relative gamut area index (Ga) ranging between 90 and 120. Results show that object appearance was rated as more attractive for light sources with a larger colour gamut, which have Ra values of 80 and lower. In general, light sources with relatively high spectral power in the long wavelength range, enhancing red objects, received the highest preference. We conclude that, next to fidelity, colour saturation makes a significant contribution to the appreciation of a light source. We therefore propose using Ra in conjunction with Ga and a colour rendering graphic for providing a more detailed description of the colour quality of white LED light sources.},

The retinal photopigment(s) transducing these light responses in humans have not been characterised. * 2 Using the ability of light to suppress nocturnal melatonin production, we aimed to investigate its spectral sensitivity and produce an action spectrum. Melatonin suppression was quantified in 22 volunteers in 215 light exposure trials using monochromatic light (30 min pulse administered at circadian time (CT) 16-18) of different wavelengths ({$\lambda$}max 424, 456, 472, 496, 520 and 548 nm) and irradiances (0.7-65.0 {$\mu$}W cm-2). * 3 At each wavelength, suppression of plasma melatonin increased with increasing irradiance. Irradiance-response curves (IRCs) were fitted and the generated half-maximal responses (IR50) were corrected for lens filtering and used to construct an action spectrum. * 4 The resulting action spectrum showed unique short-wavelength sensitivity very different from the classical scotopic and photopic visual systems. The lack of fit (r2 {$<$} 0.1) of our action spectrum with the published rod and cone absorption spectra precluded these photoreceptors from having a major role. Cryptochromes 1 and 2 also had a poor fit to the data. Fitting a series of Dartnall nomograms generated for rhodopsin-based photopigments over the {$\lambda$}max range 420-480 nm showed that rhodopsin templates between {$\lambda$}max 457 and 462 nm fitted the data well (r2{$\geq$} 0.73). Of these, the best fit was to the rhodopsin template with {$\lambda$}max 459 nm (r2= 0.74). * 5 Our data strongly support a primary role for a novel short-wavelength photopigment in light-induced melatonin suppression and provide the first direct evidence of a non-rod, non-cone photoreceptive system in humans.},

  abstract = {Light filtered through the forest canopy is the most variable physical factor in tropical forests, both in space and time. Vegetation geometry, sun angle, and weather generate five light environments, which greatly differ in intensity and spectrum. Forest light spectra can directly affect photosynthesis, plant morphogenesis, visual communication, and the effectiveness of plant-animal interactions. For animals, the apparent simplicity of five light environments is complicated by different types of contrast with the optical background which greatly modify the conspicuousness of visual signals. The purpose of this paper is to describe peculiarities of light in tropical forest, and to review the effects of light intensity and especially quality on plants and animals. Ecophysiological adaptations of plants to cope with contrasting light environments operate at daily, seasonal and life time-scales. Ambient light quality acts as a signal for both animals and plants, and consequences on plant growth, colour display, and signal design are examined. An analysis of the range of spectral parameters along a deforestation gradient is presented, testing if sites with more variation in light could support more species which are light-environment specialists. It is suggested that light quality measurement may be used to estimate the structural impact of forest exploitation, and that gives us the information necessary for a functional explanation of anthropogenic effects on tropical forest diversity.},

We demonstrate empirically that the assumptions may be reasonable and that we retrieve reasonably well the illumination for some images. On these images, we also have access to a good estimate of the spectral properties of the illumination while increasing the number of bands. However, some other images do not provide a very good illuminant estimation. We also show that the result depends mostly on the scene, rather than on the hypothesis made or on the number of spectral bands. Besides, the influence of the algorithm and its hypothesis is more critical for more bands than for the 3 - D color case.},

Furthermore, the tendency to have low levels of illumination on the warm side can distort color relationships.

The sequence of transforms involved in constructing perceptions of colour can be approximated by colour appearance models such as the CIE (2002) colour appearance model, abbreviated as CIECAM02. In this study, we test the plausibility of CIECAM02 as a model of colour processing by looking for evidence of its cortical entrainment. The CIECAM02 model predicts that colour is split in to two opposing chromatic components, red-green and cyan-yellow (termed CIECAM02-a and CIECAM02-b respectively), and an achromatic component (termed CIECAM02-A). Entrainment of cortical activity to the outputs of these components was estimated using measurements of electro- and magnetoencephalographic (EMEG) activity, recorded while healthy subjects watched videos of dots changing colour. We find entrainment to chromatic component CIECAM02-a at approximately 35\,ms latency bilaterally in occipital lobe regions, and entrainment to achromatic component CIECAM02-A at approximately 75\,ms latency, also bilaterally in occipital regions. For comparison, transforms from a less physiologically plausible model (CIELAB) were also tested, with no significant entrainment found.},

Some sequences of images were captured unsystematically while following a baboon troop, while others were designed to vary a single parameter such as aperture, object distance, time of day or position on the horizon. Images are available in the raw RGB format and in grayscale. Images are also available in units relevant to the physiology of human cone photoreceptors, where pixel values represent the expected number of photoisomerizations per second for cones sensitive to long (L), medium (M) and short (S) wavelengths.

  abstract = {The authors propose a method of image rendering to predict the incomplete chromatic-adaptation effect for paintings. A simple model of incomplete chromatic adaptation is developed to predict the appearance of the paintings under the illumination of an incandescent light source and to produce the full color image on a display device. The authors extend the von Kries framework to incomplete chromatic adaptation. An index parameter representing the degree of incomplete chromatic adaptation is defined based on the color temperature of the black-body radiators. First, the optimum value of the index parameter is determined by visual experiments on memory matching using real paintings and color patches, so that the color image produced on the display is matched to the original appearance of objects in a real scene. This approach is shown to have better performance in comparison with the traditional CIECAM02. Next, an algorithm is presented to estimate the index parameter of the incomplete adaptation index based on the image data of colorimetric rendering for a target painting. It is found that the index parameter can be estimated using only three features extracted from the color image. The color images rendered with the estimated parameter are used to predict the incomplete chromatic-adaptation effect for the original painting under the incandescent light source. The feasibility of the proposed method is confirmed based on a series of experiments using a variety of paintings. \textcopyright{} 2014 Society for Imaging Science and Technology.

Such adaptations happen at different time scales, and long-term effects are of particular interest because they may engage mechanisms of long-lasting neural plasticity. Long-term adaptation to changes in the color of the environment produce strong and long-lasting changes in color perception, with the general effect of neutralizing the dominant color. Large individual differences and details of the time course are currently unexplained, and the limits of adaptation remain unexplored. Experience with an environment appears to allow observers to adapt more strongly and quickly to it. Long-term color adaptation may serve as a model system for understanding general mechanisms of neural plasticity, including those relevant for therapies for visual disorders.},

We employed Barten's mechanistic model and adapted it for contextual modeling purposes by postulating that, signal detection in a given frequency band, when presented amongst other broadband signals, can be modeled as if amongst noise. We found that the iCSF varies with pictorial content, but that the standard CSF model and the image's contrast spectrums are sufficient to predict with relative success the cCSF for any given image. We finally discuss the suitability of cCSF models in image quality modeling.},

Besides a simultaneous presentation of standard and test illuminants, we also carried out an experiment in which the illuminants were presented successively. The results were similar to Arend and Reeves's; however, in the object-matching condition of the successive experiment, we found an overestimation, instead of an underestimation, of the illuminant component. Because the results of matching experiments are difficult to interpret, mainly due to their sensitivity to instruction effects, we introduced another type of color-constancy task. In this task, subjects simply named the color of a simulated patch. It was found that, by applying such a task, a reliable measure of the degree of identification of object color can be obtained.},

Many primate species maintain a polymorphism in color vision, whereby most individuals are dichromats but some females are trichromats, implying that selection sometimes favors dichromatic vision. Detecting camouflaged prey is thought to be a task where dichromatic individuals could have an advantage. However, previous work either has not been able to disentangle camouflage detection from other ecological or social explanations, or did not use biologically relevant cryptic stimuli to test this hypothesis under controlled conditions. Here, we used online ``citizen science'' games to test how quickly humans could detect cryptic birds (incubating nightjars) and eggs (of nightjars, plovers and coursers) under trichromatic and simulated dichromatic viewing conditions. Trichromats had an overall advantage, although there were significant differences in performance between viewing conditions. When searching for consistently shaped and patterned adult nightjars, simulated dichromats were more heavily influenced by the degree of pattern difference than were trichromats, and were poorer at detecting prey with inferior pattern and luminance camouflage. When searching for clutches of eggs\textemdash which were more variable in appearance and shape than the adult nightjars\textemdash the simulated dichromats learnt to detect the clutches faster, but were less sensitive to subtle luminance differences. These results suggest there are substantial differences in the cues available under viewing conditions that simulate different receptor types, and that these interact with the scene in complex ways to affect camouflage breaking.},

A method is described to infer the analytical densities of a color film from a set of measurements of the integral density; this provides the necessary spectroscopic information for the choice of the light source. The experimental part reports the analysis of two photographic samples from archival material: a Technicolor and an Agfacolor from the 1940s.

  abstract = {The recent discovery of melanopsin-containing retinal ganglion cells (mRGCs) has led to a fundamental reassessment of non-image forming processing, such as circadian photoentrainment and the pupillary light reflex. In the conventional view of retinal physiology, rods and cones were assumed to be the only photoreceptors in the eye and were, therefore, considered responsible for non-image processing. However, signals from mRGCs contribute to this non-image forming processing along with cone-mediated luminance signals; although both signals contribute, it is unclear how these signals are summed. We designed and built a novel multi-primary stimulation system to stimulate mRGCs independently of other photoreceptors using a silent-substitution technique within a bright steady background. The system allows direct measurements of pupillary functions for mRGCs and cones. We observed a significant change in steady-state pupil diameter when we varied the excitation of mRGC alone, with no change in luminance and colour. Furthermore, the change in pupil diameter induced by mRGCs was larger than that induced by a variation in luminance alone: that is, for a bright steady background, the mRGC signals contribute to the pupillary pathway by a factor of three times more than the L- and M-cone signals.},

Ophthalmic Physiol Opt 2011, 31, 469\textendash 479. doi: 10.1111/j.1475-1313.2011.00846.x  Abstract Purpose:\hspace{0.6em} A recent study has shown that retinal ganglion cells containing the photopigment melanopsin, which are intrinsically photosensitive in primates, project to the pupillary control centre in the pretectum. The aim of this study was to investigate how melanopsin retinal ganglion cells (mRGCs) contribute to the pupillary pathway.Methods:\hspace{0.6em} We designed and built a novel multi-primary stimulation system to control stimulation of the three cone types and mRGCs independently in the human eye. We measured the latency and amplitude of transient pupillary responses to three types of test stimuli modulating excitations of mRGCs and cones (mRGC, luminance and the light flux stimuli).Results:\hspace{0.6em} It was found that the transient pupillary response to mRGC stimuli has a longer latency than that to luminance and the light flux stimuli when an onset of sinusoidal stimulus was used.Conclusions:\hspace{0.6em} The results indicate that we successfully demonstrated the pupillary response to mRGCs under conditions where mRGCs are isolated in humans. Furthermore, the data confirm that the delayed response disappeared when the stimulus is presented as a square-wave pulse and not weighted by a sinusoid. The similarity of time courses for the earlier phase of pupillary responses to all stimuli suggested that these transient pupillary responses were driven by a single mechanism, which is perhaps associated with cone-mediated signals.},

  abstract = {It is popular to attribute the appearance of extended colour fields to a process of filling-in from the differential colour signals at colour edges, where one colour transitions to another. We ask whether such a process can account for the appearance of extended colour fields in natural images. Some form of colour filling-in must underlie the equiluminant colour Craik\textendash O'Brien\textendash Cornsweet effect and the Watercolour Effect, but these effects are too weak to account for the appearance of extended colour fields in natural images. Moreover, the graded colour disappearance effect reported as evidence for colour filling-in does not work under natural viewing conditions. We demonstrate that natural images do not look very colourful when their colour is restricted to edge transitions. Moreover, purely chromatic images with maximally graded (edgeless) transitions look fully colourful. Consequently, we conclude that colour filling-in makes no more than a minor contribution to the appearance of extended colour regions in natural images.},

Its uses have included defining tolerance intervals and ellipsoidal regions, estimating colorant spectral properties from mixtures, deriving CIE daylight, data reduction for large ensembles of spectra, and spectral imaging. Although PCA is a common topic in many engineering disciplines, statistics, and mathematics, many color-technology professionals and color-science students come from disciplines where this technique is not part of their curricula. It is from this perspective that this review publication was written. The purpose of this publication is to describe PCA and present examples in its use for colorant estimation, spectral data reduction, and defining multidimensional confidence regions for colorimetric scatter data. \textcopyright{} 2005 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

  abstract = {Perceptual choices depend not only on the current sensory input, but also on the behavioral context. An important contextual factor is the history of one's own choices. Neural activity in brain regions involved in decision formation exhibits traces of previous choices. Yet, it remains unknown how such history signals shape the dynamics of later decision formation. Models of perceptual choice construe decision formation as the accumulation of sensory evidence towards decision bounds. In this framework, it is commonly assumed that choice history signals shift the starting point of accumulation towards the bound reflecting the previous choice. We here present results that challenge this idea. We fit a bounded accumulation ('drift diffusion') decision model to behavioral data from multiple perceptual choice tasks and sensory modalities, and estimated bias terms that dependent on observers' previous choices. Individual history biases in behavior were consistently explained by a history-dependent change in the evidence accumulation, rather than in its starting point. Choice history signals thus seem to affect the interpretation of current sensory input, akin to shifting endogenous attention towards (or away from) the previously selected interpretation.},

The cone response vs intensity function was determined in the presence of adapting backgrounds up to 106 td. Increment and decrement responses, as well as the response to the steady backgrounds were recorded. All steady state and transient response data could be described with the equationV/Vm = In/(In + {$\sigma$}n) withn = 0.74 andV andI representing total response and total incident light intensity. This invariant response function is shifted both along the intensity and the response axis with increasing background intensity. The decrease in sensitivity, corresponding to these shifts, could be attributed to cellular adaptation ({$\sigma$}-adaptation), pigment bleaching and response compression. An analysis of the threshold vs intensity function shows how each of these mechanisms contributes to produce Weber behaviour.},

The illuminant resulting in the most likely semantic composition of the image is selected as the illuminant color. To evaluate the likelihood of the semantic content, we apply probabilistic latent semantic analysis. The image is modelled as a mixture of semantic classes, such as sky, grass, road, and building. The class description is based on texture, position and color information. Experiments show that the use of high-level information improves illuminant estimation over a purely bottom-up approach. Furthermore, the proposed method is shown to significantly improve semantic class recognition performance.},

The CIE color-rendering index (CRI) is a single number based on the average color difference for eight test colors. Ever since its introduction the CRI has been discussed and several suggestions have been made to improve the description of the CRI such as color preference index, color appearance data and color discrimination index. New lighting technologies such as LEDs can have spectral power distributions consisting of narrow spectral bands in the red, green and blue region of the spectrum. There are indications that the CRI does not always provide a reliable description of the color-rendering properties of these LED based light sources. In this article the principal elements of the CRI calculation are analyzed and their influence on the color-rendering description will be discussed. The focus of the analysis has been on the selection of object colors. Principally the color-rendering description of a light source should not depend on the set of colors chosen for the calculation. From our analysis requirements for such color sets are given. \textcopyright{} 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Col Res Appl, 2010},

WORCS constitutes a step-by-step procedure that researchers can follow to make a research project open and reproducible. It is based on best practices, and can be used either in parallel to, or in absence of, top-down requirements by journals, institutions, and funding bodies. This workflow is primarily targeted towards scholars working in R on a private computer, conducting research that involves academic prose, analysis code, and (optionally) tabular data - but it is flexible enough to accommodate many other scenarios. To facilitate widespread adoption, the WORCS principles are implemented in the R package worcs, which offers an RStudio project template that is, effectively, a "one-click solution" for R users. This paper introduces the workflow, discusses how it meets different requirements of open science, and provides examples of the implementation of worcs in R.},

Information about weak stimuli could be lost at successive stages en route from the visual to the frontal cortex, and these propagation failures were confirmed through microstimulation of area V1. Fluctuations in response bias and sensitivity during perception of identical stimuli were traced back to prestimulus brain-state markers. A model in which stimuli become consciously reportable when they elicit a nonlinear ignition process in higher cortical areas explained our results.},

McGraw and Wong introduced this "common language effect size statistic" for normal distributions and then proposed an approximate estimation for any continuous distribution. In addition, they generalized CL to the n-group case, the correlated samples case, and the discrete values case., In the current paper a different generalization of CL,  called the A measure of stochastic superiority, is proposed, which may be directly applied for any discrete or continuous variable that is at least ordinally scaled. Exact methods for point and interval estimation as well as the significance tests of the A = .5 hypothesis are provided. New generalizations ofCL are provided for the multi-group and correlated samples cases.},

  abstract = {Color-tuning curves were obtained for 218 cells in the foveal striate cortex of behaving macaques. Each cell was tested with its optimal spatial stimulus. Test colors (14 interference filters, 4 Wratten filters, and white) were matched for human photopic luminosity and presented at luminance levels sufficient to induce vigorous responding from most cells. One hundred eighty-four cells were selected for further analysis on the basis of a color-tuning index. Of these, 130 with tuning curves that correlated well (0.9 or better) with other tuning curves were studied in detail. Individual cells were found with peak responses to every color tested. Sixty-three tuning curves fell into the six largest cross-correlation groups, containing 15, 14, 12, 9, 7, and 6 cells, with mean tuning-curve peaks at 450, 656, 656, 506, 577, and 506 nm, respectively. Cross-correlation groups having the same peak location (656 nm, 506 nm) were distinguishable on the basis of tuning-curve width. Response patterns, cone input estimates, and comparison with human psychophysics suggest that two of these cell groups function as an opponent pair processing the colors red and green. Two other cell groups process the colors blue and yellow but show less well-developed opponency. Microdrive depth readings, correlated with histological lesion sites, show these "red," "green," "blue," and "yellow" cells to be most common in layer 4 of the striate cortex.}

The goal of this work is to develop light systems and sources with an optimized spectral distribution for each specific point of the art piece. This optimization process implies to maximize the color fidelity reproduction and the same time to minimize the photochemical damage. Perceived color under these sources will be similar (metameric) to technical requirements given by the restoration team uncharged of the conservation and exhibition of the goods of art. Depending of the fragility of the exposed art objects (i.e. spectral responsivity of the material) the irradiance must be kept under a critical level. Therefore, it is necessary to develop a mathematical model that simulates with enough accuracy both the visual effect of the illumination and the photochemical impact of the radiation. Spectral reflectance of a reference painting The mathematical model is based on a merit function that optimized the individual intensity of the LED-light sources taking into account the damage function of the material and color space coordinates. Moreover the algorithm used weights for damage and color fidelity in order to adapt the model to a specific museal application. In this work we show a sample of this technology applied to a picture of Sorolla (1863-1923) an important Spanish painter title ``woman walking at the beach''.},

Advantages of these systems are very well known: timelife, size, compact, variation of output flux,... One of the most applied characteristic is the possibility to obtain with the same system different colors. It is possible without complex and expensive systems to obtain a tunable spectral light. In cultural heritage lighting system it will be a very important characteristic since it will make possible to obtain an optimized spectral source. Art works lighting is a very complex problem where needs for display and conservation are in conflict. Electromagnetic radiation is an agent which causes changes in material composition of painting and therefore degradation of them. In the other hand displaying art works in good conditions requires visible radiation onto the surface of paintings. This idea is applied in the problem which arise when illuminanting Paleolithic cave paintings. In this work the authors have applied a methodology which permits optimize the color reproduction and to reduce the damage of paintings.},

In our experiments we used a colour tuneable light source, with which the subjects were requested to set the most pleasing light, when the source illuminated real paintings (painted copies of classical art work). Observers were asked for the most preferred correlated colour temperature. The main goal of this study was to find best CCT of the illuminant. The other goal was to find which personal (like gender) indicators, settings of illuminants can influence the colour preference.},

Normal color observers performed multiple Rayleigh matches (i.e., a series of seven Rayleigh-type color matches using various sets of test and primary lights) in order to derive estimates of the M- and L-photo pigment wavelengths of maximum absorbance. We predicted the ratio of incident radiances Pr/Pg for a range of plausible values in terms of wavelength of the peak sensitivity of the M-cone and L-cone. An algorithm allowed us to adjust the values of the peak wavelength of the cone photo pigments in order to minimize the sum of squared differences between predicted and real results of matches. To create candidate M-cone and L-cone photo pigments that best predict the set of equation values, we used the low density spectral absorbance curves of the M-cone and L-cone photo pigments respectively, as tabulated by Stockman and Sharpe (2000), and shifted each template along a logarithmic wavelength scale. For all observers, the system of seven Rayleigh-like equations converges to a unique solution. M- and L-cone photo pigments are estimated separately. The distribution of the wavelength of maximum sensitivity of the photo pigments includes a cluster. Only a few women's results lie outside the cluster. The choice of the template has a considerable influence on the convergence of the algorithm.},

After careful examination of color matching data, TC 1- 36 has agreed on proposing a continuous fundamental observer with data from 10\textdegree{} to 1\textdegree. The 10\textdegree{} color matching measurements of Stiles and Burch (1959) will provide the basic data for this continuous fundamental observer. Fundamental response curves will be derived as a function of field size, taking into account the macular pigment, the ocular media and the photopigment optical densities.},

  abstract = {The generic framework of metamerism implies that the number of sensors is smaller than the dimension of the stimulus. The metameric black paradigm was introduced by Wyszecki [Farbe2, 39 (1953)] and developed by Cohen and Kappauf [Am. J. Psychol.95, 537 (1982)]. Within a multireceptor and multiprimary scheme, we investigate how far the choice of illumination can isolate a photoreceptor response. The spectral profiles of the fundamental metamers that correspond to a collection of (x,y) values over the chromaticity diagram are shown. When the luminance is set at a fixed value, the relative excitation of the melanopsin cells and of the rods elicited by the fundamental metamers varies over the chromaticity diagram. The range of excitation of the melanopsin cells and of the rods that could be achieved at a given chromaticity, by manipulating the metameric black content, is examined. When only the melanopsin excitation is manipulated, the range of melanopsin excitation that can be achieved is rather limited. On the chromaticity diagram, the largest range of variation of the rods and the melanopsin cells excitation is obtained for (x,y) chromaticity coordinates near (1/3,1/3). Extension of Cohen's procedure to rod and cone metamers is proposed. The higher the number of spectral bands, the wider the choice of metameric lights.},

Besides certain ambient influences the main factor governing these effects is the spectral irradiance applied to the surface. As the photochemical efficiency of electromagnetic radiation depends on its wavelength it is desirable to know the effect of individual spectral components in order to estimate the damage potential of a certain light source. In this work the modifications of the reflectance spectra of 40 dyes and pigments relevant in historical book illumination resulting from irradiation by eight narrow band LED light sources are presented. The LED wavelengths cover the visible part of the electromagnetic spectrum. Based on the measured reflectance spectra, color values are calculated and their evolution is studied as a function of the amount of radiation applied.},

  abstract = {There is theoretical and empirical support for long-term adaptation of human vision to chromatic regularities in the environment. The current study investigates whether relationships of luminance and chromaticity in the natural environment could drive chromatic adaptation independently and differently for bright and dark colors. This is motivated by psychophysical evidence of systematic difference shifts in red\textendash green chromatic sensitivities between contextually bright- versus dark-colored stimuli. For some broad classes of scene content, consistent shifts in chromaticity are found between high and low light levels within images. Especially in those images in which sky and terrain are juxtaposed, this shift has direction and magnitude consistent with the observed psychophysical shifts in the red\textendash green balance between bright and dark colors. Taken together, these findings suggest that relative weighting of M- and L-cone signals could be adapted, in a luminance-dependent fashion, to regularities in the natural environment.},

  abstract = {Panel tests of color vision (eg FM100-Hue test) lack a common quantitative method for the scoring of cap arrangements. We describe a scoring method applicable to all panel tests that makes use of a novel technique to analyze test cap data, namely the calculation of a moment of inertia from the Color Difference Vectors (CDVs) of any arrangement pattern. Using the Farnsworth D-15 panel, as an example, we specify how to determine CDVs and demonstrate the benefits of calculating a moment of inertia for the analysis of these vectors. Moment of inertia analysis yields three factors which quantify cap arrangements: the first is the confusion angle which identifies the type of color defect; the second is the Confusion index (C-index) which quantifies the degree of color loss relative to a perfect arrangement of caps; and the third is the Selectivity index (S-index) which quantifies the amount of polarity or lack of randomness in a cap arrangement. A retrospective study on the result of 53 normal and 66 congenitally color defective observers is reported and provides normative data. We show that the technique differentiates between different types of color defect and provides useful clinical information regarding a loss of color vision. Likewise, a similar observation is made on a smaller sample of FM100-Hue results. A BASIC computer program is provided for anyone wishing to use the technique.},

While both types of faces activate similar visual areas, faces of close others activate areas involved in processing social and semantic information. Here, we used between-subject linear classifiers trained on hyperaligned brain data to investigate the neural code for visual and semantic information about familiar others. The identity of both visually and personally familiar faces could be decoded across participants from brain activity in visual areas. Instead, only the identity of personally familiar faces could be decoded in areas involved in social cognition. Our results suggest that individually distinctive information associated with familiar faces is embedded in a neural code that is shared across brains.           ,              Processes evoked by seeing a personally familiar face encompass recognition of visual appearance and activation of social and person knowledge. Whereas visual appearance is the same for all viewers, social and person knowledge may be more idiosyncratic. Using between-subject multivariate decoding of hyperaligned functional magnetic resonance imaging data, we investigated whether representations of personally familiar faces in different parts of the distributed neural system for face perception are shared across individuals who know the same people. We found that the identities of both personally familiar and merely visually familiar faces were decoded accurately across brains in the core system for visual processing, but only the identities of personally familiar faces could be decoded across brains in the extended system for processing nonvisual information associated with faces. Our results show that personal interactions with the same individuals lead to shared neural representations of both the seen and unseen features that distinguish their identities.},

  abstract = {Everything that is visible has certain colour-properties'' (Katz, 1911, p. 1). In this chapter we first discuss the structure and perceptual dimensions that are inherent to the attribute of colour itself. We then consider the strong organisational influence that colour can have on scenes, before considering the interplay of colour, form, depth and movement, to the extent that these interactions influence our perceptual organisation. We discuss spatial factors as they bear on colour, in classical displays of colour contrast and assimilation and the way in which these are modified by perceptual grouping. Finally we consider a world of illuminated objects, highlighting the spatio-chromatic signatures associated with changes in illumination or spectrally selective filtering, and the subtle chromatic cues to material properties. Colour emerges as a subject of perception, that ``draws its beauty from the marvellous co-operation of colour-substance and illumination'' (Katz, 1911, p. 2), and as the perceptual correlate of a physical signature that supports our visual appreciation of things made of particular stuff.},

  abstract = {Twilight is characterised by changes in both quantity (``irradiance'') and quality (``colour'') of light. Animals use the variation in irradiance to adjust their internal circadian clocks, aligning their behaviour and physiology with the solar cycle. However, it is currently unknown whether changes in colour also contribute to this entrainment process. Using environmental measurements, we show here that mammalian blue\textendash yellow colour discrimination provides a more reliable method of tracking twilight progression than simply measuring irradiance. We next use electrophysiological recordings to demonstrate that neurons in the mouse suprachiasmatic circadian clock display the cone-dependent spectral opponency required to make use of this information. Thus, our data show that some clock neurons are highly sensitive to changes in spectral composition occurring over twilight and that this input dictates their response to changes in irradiance. Finally, using mice housed under photoperiods with simulated dawn/dusk transitions, we confirm that spectral changes occurring during twilight are required for appropriate circadian alignment under natural conditions. Together, these data reveal a new sensory mechanism for telling time of day that would be available to any mammalian species capable of chromatic vision.},

Both the lesioned and the control animals made more errors when the stimuli to be discriminated belonged to the same colour category than when they belonged to different categories and thus showed normal colour categorization. The results suggest that monkeys with V4 lesions perceive the colour spectrum according to the same fundamental perceptual categories as normal monkeys and humans, and thus support the view that, in the colour domain, the four basic perceptual categories are constructed by chromatic mechanisms operating earlier than visual area V4.},

In Expt. 1 they were tested for the reacquisition of a pre-operatively learned hue discrimination task. In Expt. 2, as a test of colour constancy, the monkeys were required to perform previously overlearned colour discrimination tasks when the amounts of red, green and blue light in the illuminant were changed. In Expt. 3 the animals were compared on the post-operative acquisition of hue, greyness and saturation discrimination tasks. The results of Expt. 1 showed that monkeys with V4 lesions can regain their pre-operative levels of performance on hue discrimination tasks. Expt. 2 showed that monkeys with V4 lesions have a colour constancy deficit. Expt. 3 reinforced the finding that the animals with V4 lesions could learn to perform fine hue discriminations but that their final, asymptotic performance was not as reliable as that of normal animals. The wavelength discrimination data are discussed within the context of recent electrophysiological findings that V4 is involved in selective attention to visual stimuli and the constancy data are interpreted as evidence that V4 is important for defining colour constancy thresholds but not for constructing the perceptual categories underlying constant colour perception.},

The preferred light settings identified in these studies, however, had high values of colour fidelity and colour gamut. It has been speculated that the preference was caused by good colour rendition, rather than chromaticity. This article reports a pilot study in which the spectral power distributions of the light settings were carefully designed using a genetic algorithm. Twenty-three observers evaluated pairs of light settings at 3000\,K and 6500\,K with different chromaticities, in terms of Duv, but similar colour rendition as characterized using the IES TM-30-15 Rf, Rg, and Color Vector Graphic. It was found that the light settings with Duv of -0.02 and -0.03 were most preferred among the 3000\,K settings; while the settings with Duv of 0 and -0.01 were most preferred among the 6500\,K settings. Further studies regarding how chromaticity alone affects preference under different viewing conditions and adaptation conditions will be valuable to better understand human preference for light stimuli.},

  abstract = {This paper presents a framework for the real-time rendering of plant leaves with global illumination effects. Realistic rendering of leaves requires a sophisticated appearance model and accurate lighting computation. For leaf appearance we introduce a parametric model that describes leaves in terms of spatially-variant BRDFs and BTDFs. These BRDFs and BTDFs, incorporating analysis of subsurface scattering inside leaf tissues and rough surface scattering on leaf surfaces, can be measured from real leaves. More importantly, this description is compact and can be loaded into graphics hardware for fast run-time shading calculations, which are essential for achieving high frame rates. For lighting computation, we present an algorithm that extends the Precomputed Radiance Transfer (PRT) approach to all-frequency lighting for leaves. In particular, we handle the combined illumination effects due to lowfrequency environment light and high-frequency sunlight. This is done by decomposing the local incident radiance of sunlight into direct and indirect components. The direct component, which contains most of the high frequencies, is not pre-computed with spherical harmonics as in PRT; instead it is evaluated on-the-fly using pre-computed light-visibility convolution data. We demonstrate our framework by the rendering of a variety of leaves and assemblies thereof.},

There is almost no function in the human body which is not affected by lead toxicity. Though in countries like US and Canada the use of lead has been controlled up to a certain extent, it is still used vehemently in the developing countries. This is primarily because lead bears unique physical and chemical properties that make it suitable for a large number of applications for which humans have exploited its benefits from historical times and thus it has become a common environmental pollutant. Lead is highly persistent in the environment and because of its continuous use its levels rise in almost every country, posing serious threats. This article reviews the works listed in the literature with recent updates regarding the toxicity of lead. Focus is also on toxic effects of lead on the renal, reproductive and nervous system. Finally the techniques available for treating lead toxicity are presented with some recent updates.},

  abstract = {In recent years, trends towards studying simulated games have gained momentum in the fields of artificial intelligence, cognitive science, psychology, and neuroscience. The intersections of these fields have also grown recently, as researchers increasing study such games using both artificial agents and human or animal subjects. However, implementing games can be a time-consuming endeavor and may require a researcher to grapple with complex codebases that are not easily customized. Furthermore, interdisciplinary researchers studying some combination of artificial intelligence, human psychology, and animal neurophysiology face additional challenges, because existing platforms are designed for only one of these domains. Here we introduce Modular Object-Oriented Games, a Python task framework that is lightweight, flexible, customizable, and designed for use by machine learning, psychology, and neurophysiology researchers.},

  abstract = {Imaging techniques inform the conservation, research, and understanding of museum collections. Two types of imaging techniques were examined in this study: infrared (IR) and three-dimensional (3D) imaging. Reflected IR imaging is well established as an investigative tool for conservation providing information about condition, materials, and manufacture beyond visible light documentation. Reflected IR imaging results in two-dimensional images, which are limited in how they represent 3D objects. Three-dimensional imaging techniques, such as white light scanning and photogrammetry, extend the possibilities of digitization by recording the geometry and texture of an object. Reflected IR imaging, photogrammetry, and white light scanning were used to document six objects from the Freud Museum and the Smithsonian National Museum of the American Indian. The present study provides examples of reflected IR imaging for enhanced detection of features of 3D cultural heritage objects; discusses the potential of integrating reflected IR and 3D imaging to more fully document features of 3D objects; and investigates two 3D imaging techniques, white light scanning and photogrammetry. The study assesses the two 3D imaging techniques, one more expensive and the other more accessible, to discover whether there is a significant difference in performance for the purpose of resolving the details recorded by reflected IR imaging.},

  abstract = {Spectral and 3D imaging techniques are used for museum imaging and cultural heritage documentation providing complementary information to aid in documenting the condition, informing the care, and increasing our understanding of objects. Specialised devices for spectral and 3D imaging may not be accessible for many heritage institutions, due to cost and complexity, and the modification of a consumer digital camera presents the potential of an accessible scientific tool for 2D and 3D spectral imaging. Consumer digital cameras are optimised for visible light, colour photography, but the underlying sensor is inherently sensitive to near ultraviolet, visible, and near infrared radiation. This research presents the characterisation of a modified camera to investigate the impact of the modification on the spectroradiometric and geometric image quality with the intention of the device being used as a scientific tool for cultural heritage documentation. The characterisation includes the assessment of 2D image quality looking at visual noise, sharpness, and sampling efficiency using the target and software associated with the Federal Agencies Digitization Guidelines Initiative. Results suggest that these modifications give rise to discrepancies in computed surface geometries of the order of {$\pm$} 0.1 mm for small to medium sized objects used in the study and recorded in the round (maximum dimension 20 cm). Measuring the spectral response quantifies the modified camera as a scientific device for more accurate measurements and provides indications of wavelengths that could improve documentation based on sensitivity. The modification of a consumer digital camera provides a less expensive, high-resolution option for 2D and 3D spectral imaging.},

  abstract = {Color perception depends profoundly on adaptation processes that adjust sensitivity in response to the prevailing pattern of stimulation. We examined how color sensitivity and appearance might be influenced by adaptation to the color distributions characteristic of natural images. Color distributions were measured for natural scenes by sampling an array of locations within each scene with a spectroradiometer, or by recording each scene with a digital camera successively through 31 interference filters. The images were used to reconstruct the L, M and S cone excitation at each spatial location, and the contrasts along three post-receptoral axes [L + M, L - M or S - (L + M)]. Individual scenes varied substantially in their mean chromaticity and luminance, in the principal color-luminance axes of their distributions, and in the range of contrasts in their distributions. Chromatic contrasts were biased along a relatively narrow range of bluish to yellowish-green angles, lying roughly between the S - (L + M) axis (which was more characteristic of scenes with lush vegetation and little sky) and a unique blue-yellow axis (which was more typical of arid scenes). For many scenes L - M and S - (L + M) signals were highly correlated, with weaker correlations between luminance and chromaticity. We use a two-stage model (von Kries scaling followed by decorrelation) to show how the appearance of colors may be altered by light adaptation to the mean if the distributions and by contrast adaptation to the contrast range and principal axes of the distributions; and we show that such adjustments are qualitatively consistent with empirical measurements of asymmetric color matches obtained after adaptation to successive random samples drawn from natural distributions of chromaticities and lightnesses. Such adaptation effects define the natural range of operating states of the visual system.},

  abstract = {Many perceptual dimensions are thought to be represented relative to an average value or norm. Models of norm-based coding assume that the norm appears psychologically neutral because it reflects a neutral response in the underlying neural code. We tested this assumption in human color vision by asking how judgments of ``white'' are affected as neural responses are altered by adaptation. The adapting color was varied to determine the stimulus level that did not bias the observer's subjective white point. This level represents a response norm at the stages at which sensitivity is regulated by the adaptation, and we show that these response norms correspond to the perceptually neutral stimulus and that they can account for how the perception of white varies both across different observers and within the same observer at different locations in the visual field. We also show that individual differences in perceived white are reduced when observers are exposed to a common white adapting stimulus, suggesting that the perceptual differences are due in part to differences in how neural responses are normalized. These results suggest a close link between the norms for appearance and coding in color vision and illustrate a general paradigm for exploring this link in other perceptual domains.},

  abstract = {Most models of color vision assume that signals from the three classes of cone receptor are recoded into only three independent post-receptoral channels: one that encodes luminance and two that encode color. Stimuli that are equated for their effects on two of the channels should be discriminable only to the remaining channel, and are thus assumed to isolate the responses of single channels. We used an asymmetric matching task to examine whether such models can account for changes in color appearance following adaptation to contrast\textemdash to temporal variations in luminance and chromaticity around a fixed mean luminance and chromaticity. The experiments extend to suprathreshold color appearance the threshold adaptation paradigm of Krauskopf, Williams and Heeley [(1982) Vision Research, 32, 1123\textendash 1131]. Adaptation changes the perceived color of chromatic test stimuli both by reducing their saturation (contrast) and by changing their hue (direction within the equiluminant plane). The saturation losses are largest for test stimuli that lie along the chromatic axis defining the adapting modulation, while the hue changes are rotations away from the adapting direction and toward an orthogonal direction within the S and L \textemdash{} M plane. Similar selective changes in both perceived color and perceived lightness occur following adaptation to stimuli that covary in luminance and chromaticity. The selectivity of the aftereffects for multiple directions within color-luminance space is inconsistent with sensitivity changes in only three independent channels. These aftereffects suggest instead that color appearance depends on channels that can be selectively tuned to any color-luminance direction, and that there are no directions that invariably isolate responses in only a single channel. We use the perceived color changes to examine the spectral sensitivities of the chromatic channels and to estimate the distribution of channels. We also examine how adaptation alters the contrast-response function, how it affects reaction times for luminance and chromatic contrast, the extent to which the aftereffects exhibit interocular transfer, and the way in which the perceived color changes differ from those induced by conventional light adaptation.},

  abstract = {Color appearance depends on adaptation processes that adjust sensitivity both to the average color in the stimulus (through light or chromatic adaptation) and to the variations in color (through contrast adaptation). We explored how these different forms of adaptation interact, by examining how the state of chromatic adaptation depends on the time-varying color contrasts in the stimulus, and conversely, how adaptation to the mean determines the stimulus contrasts underlying contrast adaptation. Light adaptation levels remain very similar whether observers adapt to a static chromaticity or to large temporal modulations in cone excitation that vary at rates of 0.5 Hz or higher. This suggests that up to the sites of light adaptation, the response to moderate contrasts is effectively linear and that the adaptation effectively averages over several seconds of the stimulus. For slower flicker rates color is differentially biased by the last half-cycle of the flicker, and perceived contrast may be altered by response polarization. This polarization selectively saturates responses to moderate (but not low) contrasts along the color direction complementary to the mean color bias, implying that the response changes occur within multiple mechanisms tuned to different chromatic axes. Chromatic adaptation often adjusts only partially to the mean color of the stimulus, and thus leaves a residual bias in the color appearance of the field. Contrast adaptation reduces perceived contrast relative to this residual color, and not relative to the stimulus that appears achromatic. Similarly, contrast discrimination thresholds appear lower around the residual color than around the achromatic point. Thus under biased states of chromatic adaptation alternative measures of `zero contrast' can be dissociated, suggesting that they do not depend on a common null point within the channels encoding chromatic contrast.},

The images were recorded with an RGB digital camera calibrated to yield estimates of the L, M, and S cone excitations and chromatic and luminance contrasts at each pixel. These were compared across time and location and were analyzed separately for regions of earth and sky. Seasonal climate changes alter both the average color in scenes and how the colors are distributed around the average. Arid periods are marked by a mean shift toward the +L pole of the L vs. M chromatic axis and a rotation in the color distributions away from the S vs. LM chromatic axis and toward an axis of bluish\textendash yellowish variation, both primarily due to changes in vegetation. The form of the change was similar at the two locations suggesting that the color statistics of natural images undergo a characteristic pattern of temporal variation.

Observers set unique hues for moderately saturated equiluminant stimuli by varying their hue angle within a plane defined by the LvsM and SvsLM cone-opponent axes that are thought to characterize early postreceptoral color coding. Unique red settings were close to the +L pole of the LvsM axis, while green, blue, and yellow settings clustered along directions intermediate to the LvsM and SvsLM axes and thus corresponded to particular ratios of LvsM to SvsLM activity. Interobserver differences in the unique hues were substantial. However, no relationship was found between hue settings and relative sensitivity to the LvsM and SvsLM axes. Moreover, interobserver variations in different unique hues were uncorrelated and were thus inconsistent with a common underlying factor such as relative sensitivity or changes in the spectral sensitivities of the cones. Thus for the moderately saturated lights we tested, the unique hues appear largely unconstrained by normal individual differences in the cone-opponent axes. In turn, this suggests that the perceived hue for these stimuli does not depend on fixed (common) physiological weightings of the cone-opponent axes or on fixed (common) color signals in the environment.},

We asked whether focal colors can also differ systematically across different groups of individuals living in potentially different color environments, by measuring focal and unique hues for observers in India and the United States. Differences between groups were generally small relative to the within-group variations, consistent with a strong common basis for color naming across diverse contexts. However, for most hues the average settings differed significantly across subpopulations. These differences persisted across testing conditions and thus probably reflect longer-term contextual influences on color appearance judgments. They suggest that while color categories may be qualitatively similar, precisely how the hue spectrum is parsed may differ quantitatively across different populations of observers. Both the between-group and the within-group differences are inconsistent with the differences predicted by common peripheral sources of variation in color vision (e.g., in lens or macular pigment) and may reflect an influence of environmental or cultural differences in focal color choices.},

  abstract = {Conventional models of color vision assume that blue and yellow (along with red and green) are the fundamental building blocks of color appearance, yet how these hues are represented in the brain and whether and why they might be special are questions that remain shrouded in mystery. Many studies have explored the visual encoding of color categories, from the statistics of the environment to neural processing to perceptual experience. Blue and yellow are tied to salient features of the natural color world, and these features have likely shaped several important aspects of color vision. However, it remains less certain that these dimensions are encoded as primary or ``unique'' in the visual representation of color. There are also striking differences between blue and yellow percepts that may reflect high-level inferences about the world, specifically about the colors of light and surfaces. Moreover, while the stimuli labeled as blue or yellow or other basic categories show a remarkable degree of constancy within the observer, they all vary independently of one another across observers. This pattern of variation again suggests that blue and yellow and red and green are not a primary or unitary dimension of color appearance, and instead suggests a representation in which different hues reflect qualitatively different categories rather than quantitative differences within an underlying low-dimensional ``color space.''},

A second important trend has been the realization that the processes of adaptation are themselves essential to how vision works and thus likely operate at all levels. That is, ``if it's there, it adapts.'' This observation has focused interest on the mechanisms of adaptation as the target rather than the probe. Together, these approaches have led to an emerging view of adaptation as a fundamental and ubiquitous coding strategy impacting all aspects of how we see.},

  abstract = {A psychophysical experiment was conducted to investigate brightness perception and color preference under illumination from typical 3000 K blue-pumped light emitting diode (LED) A19 lamps (BP-LED) and 3000 K blue-pumped LED A19 lamps with diminished yellow emission (YD-LED). Eighty-seven participants between 19 and 25 years completed brightness matching and preference comparisons between two full-size side-by-side rooms that contained chromatic objects and still life arrangements, with one lamp type in each room. Participants had higher overall preference to the room illuminated by YD-LED. Specifically, red, green, orange, and wood objects were preferred under YD-LED; no preference was found for neutral, yellow, and blue objects between the two lamp types. The words saturated, vivid, vibrant, pleasant, inviting, colorful, stand-out, distinct, appealing, and comfortable were reported as reasons for the color preference under YD-LED; dull, dead, and fade were used by participants to describe the lower color preference under BP-LED. Skin tone preference under the illumination of these two lamp types was significantly different between Asian (n = 32) and Caucasian (n = 52) participants. Caucasians evaluated their own skin tone more favorably under YD-LED, with the average assessment that skin appeared healthy and colorful under YD-LED but grey and pale under BP-LED. No preference between the two lamps was found among Asians for their skin tone, though some Asians thought YD-LED rendered their skin too red and odd. Many existing measures of color preference and gamut were able to predict the higher overall preference to YD-LED, but they could not predict the preference of specific colors or for ethnic groups. The higher saturation and preference for red and green colors under YD-LED illumination is consistent with the higher red\textendash green opponent signal provided by YD-LED. Coupled with several past studies, the spectral region around 570\textendash 580 nm appears to be deleterious to color and brightness perception.},

In the first, two side-by-side booths were designed to resemble a retail setting with clothing; in the second, a single booth was designed to resemble a restaurant setting, but also included a mirror to permit the observer's evaluation of skin tone. These settings were illuminated with two sets of sources, where, compared to a fixed reference, one set created modest chroma enhancement and the other set created greater increases in object chroma. Within each set, gamut shape varied, meaning different hues were saturated, even though, on average, the spectra created the same average increase in chroma. When objects were unfamiliar, as with the fabrics, all chroma-enhancing spectra were preferred to the fixed reference regardless of the gamut shapes. When familiar objects were present, such as food, observers were more discerning about changes in chroma and hue. We conclude that a graphic of gamut shape is an important adjunct to average measures of colour fidelity and gamut.},

  abstract = {In lighting practice, light level is seldom considered when specifying light source color rendition. Many past studies found that sources that can enhance color saturation within a certain range, especially for red colors, were preferred, but the experiments were typically carried out with an illuminance between 200 and 500 lx and the illuminance was seldom varied in individual studies. This article reports a psychophysical study that was designed to test whether illuminance affected color preference. Four nearly metameric stimuli with a correlated color temperature (CCT) around 3000 K and a Duv of -0.005 were produced to illuminate an oil painting at two illuminance levels (that is, 20 and 500 lx). These four stimuli were carefully designed to cover a range of relative gamut (that is, IES Rg) from 100 to 125 and enhance the saturation of red and green colors (that is, Rcs,h1 and Rcs,h8). Observers compared pairs of light stimuli at a same illuminance level in a sequential mode and selected the one under which he or she preferred the color appearance of the painting. It was found that the Rg of the most preferred stimulus decreased as the illuminance increased. The stimulus with an Rg {$\approx$} 117 was the most preferred at 20 lx, whereas the one with an Rg {$\approx$} 100 was the most preferred at 500 lx. The interaction between illuminance and saturation enhancement caused by the stimuli with larger gamut areas revealed the importance of considering illuminance when specifying light source color rendition, especially when an application requires a low light level and good color rendition.},

We demonstrate that perceptual bias and discriminability, as functions of the stimulus value, follow a surprisingly simple mathematical relation. The relation, which is derived from a theory combining optimal encoding and decoding, is well supported by a wide range of reported psychophysical data including perceptual changes induced by contextual modulation. The large empirical support indicates that the proposed relation may represent a psychophysical law in human perception. Our results imply that the computational processes of sensory encoding and perceptual decoding are matched and optimized based on identical assumptions about the statistical structure of the sensory environment.},

Since better colour rendition generally comes with a penalty in luminous efficacy, it is reasonable to consider the balance: Should colour and whiteness rendition be sacrificed to achieve higher efficacy? Here, we investigate perceptual responses under illumination from two sources, a blue-pumped LED with a colour rendering index of 85 (BLED85), and a violet-pumped LED with a colour rendering index of 97 (VLED97). Forty-eight participants completed three experiments. Neutral, red, and pink were preferred under VLED97. Skin rendition was preferred by Caucasians under VLED97; Asians had no preference. Teeth and a white shirt were whiter and more preferred under VLED97. We conclude that the colour and whiteness rendition must be considered on a par with luminous efficacy.},

  abstract = {Measuring and interpreting errors in behavioral tasks is critical for understanding cognition. Conventional wisdom assumes that encoding/decoding errors for continuous variables in behavioral tasks should naturally have Gaussian distributions, so that deviations from normality in the empirical data indicate the presence of more complex sources of noise. This line of reasoning has been central for prior research on working memory. Here we re-assess this assumption, and find that even in ideal observer models with Gaussian encoding noise, the error distribution is generally non-Gaussian, contrary to the commonly held belief. Critically, we find that the shape of the error distribution is determined by the geometrical structure of the encoding manifold via a simple rule. In the case of a high-dimensional geometry, the error distributions naturally exhibit flat tails. Using this novel insight, we apply our theory to visual short-term memory tasks, and find that it can account for a large array of experimental data with only two free parameters. Our results call attention to the geometry of the representation as a critically important, yet underappreciated factor in determining the character of errors in human behavior.},

Neither article offered an explanation for why that occurred. In this article we suggest that chromaticity may not be the sole cause of preference. The preference to the light stimuli reported in these two articles may be due to the combined effects of color rendition and chromaticity. Through simulation, we show that illuminants with chromaticity below the blackbody locus (that is, negative Duv) are more likely to have higher scores for relative gamut (for example, Qg) than illuminants on or above the blackbody locus, while maintaining high scores for fidelity (for example, Qf). Future psychophysical studies that separate the effects of chromaticity and color rendition will be necessary to more fully understand preference for light stimuli.},

A well-known color constancy method is based on the gray-world assumption which assumes that the average reflectance of surfaces in the world is achromatic. In this paper, we propose a new hypothesis for color constancy namely the gray-edge hypothesis, which assumes that the average edge difference in a scene is achromatic. Based on this hypothesis, we propose an algorithm for color constancy. Contrary to existing color constancy algorithms, which are computed from the zero-order structure of images, our method is based on the derivative structure of images. Furthermore, we propose a framework which unifies a variety of known (gray-world, max-RGB, Minkowski norm) and the newly proposed gray-edge and higher order gray-edge algorithms. The quality of the various instantiations of the framework is tested and compared to the state-of-the-art color constancy methods on two large data sets of images recording objects under a large number of different light sources. The experiments show that the proposed color constancy algorithms obtain comparable results as the state-of-the-art color constancy methods with the merit of being computationally more efficient.},

In the first experiment, we measured colour naming for the illumination and for the colour induced by the illumination on the colorimetric grey. Results confirmed that the induced colours are approximately complementary to the colour of the illumination. In the second experiment, we measured colour constancy using achromatic adjustments. Average colour constancy was perfect under the blue daylight illumination and decreased in colour directions away from the blue daylight illumination due to undershooting and a strong blue bias. Apart from this blue bias, colour constancy was not related to illumination discrimination and to chromatic detection measured previously with the same setup and stimuli. We also observed a strong negative relationship between the degree of colour constancy and the consensus of naming the illumination colour. Constancy coincided with a low naming consensus, in particular because bluish illumination colours were sometimes seen as achromatic. Blue bias and category consensus alone explained {$>$}68\%, and all determinants together explained {$>$}94\% of the variance of achromatic adjustments. These findings suggest that colour constancy is optimised for blue daylight.},

  abstract = {Summary Humans identify four `unique hues' \textemdash{} blue, green, yellow and red \textemdash{} that do not appear to contain mixtures of other colours. Unique yellow (UY) is particularly interesting because it is stable across large populations: participants reliably set a monochromatic light to a stereotypical wavelength. Individual variability in the ratio of L- and M-cones in the retina, and effects of ageing, both impact unique green (UG) settings 1, 2, but cannot predict the relatively small inter-individual differences in UY 2, 3. The stability of UY may arise because it is set by the environment rather than retinal physiology. Support for this idea comes from studies of long-term, artificial chromatic adaptation 4, 5, but there is no evidence for this process in natural settings. Here, we measured 67 participants in York (UK) in both the winter and summer, and found a significant seasonal change in UY settings. In comparison, Rayleigh colour matches that would not be expected to exhibit environmentally driven changes were found to be constant. The seasonal shift in UY settings is consistent with a model that reweights L- and M-cone inputs into a perceptual opponent colour channel after a small, seasonally-driven change in mean L:M cone activity.},

Color tuning cannot be represented by a one-dimensional curve, and measuring three-dimensional tuning curves is difficult. One approach to addressing this challenge is to analyze neuronal color tuning data through the lens of mathematical models that make assumptions about the shapes of tuning curves. In this paper, we discuss the linear-nonlinear cascade model as a platform for measuring neuronal color tuning. We compare fitting this model by three techniques: two using response-weighted averaging and one using numerical optimization of likelihood. We highlight the advantages and disadvantages of each technique and emphasize the effects of the stimulus distribution on color tuning measurements.},

  abstract = {Intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells (ipRGCs) are depolarized by light by two mechanisms: directly, through activation of their photopigment melanopsin; and indirectly through synaptic circuits driven by rods and cones. To learn more about the rod and cone circuits driving ipRGCs, we made multielectrode array (MEA) and patch-clamp recordings in wildtype and genetically modified mice. Rod-driven ON inputs to ipRGCs proved to be as sensitive as any reaching the conventional ganglion cells. These signals presumably pass in part through the primary rod pathway, involving rod bipolar cells and AII amacrine cells coupled to ON cone bipolar cells through gap junctions. Consistent with this interpretation, the sensitive rod ON input to ipRGCs was eliminated by pharmacological or genetic disruption of gap junctions, as previously reported for conventional ganglion cells. A presumptive cone input was also detectable as a brisk, synaptically mediated ON response that persisted after disruption of rod ON pathways. This was roughly three log units less sensitive than the rod input. Spectral analysis revealed that both types of cones, the M- and S-cones, contribute to this response and that both cone types drive ON responses. This contrasts with the blue-OFF, yellow-ON chromatic opponency reported in primate ipRGCs. The cone-mediated response was surprisingly persistent during steady illumination, echoing the tonic nature of both the rod input to ipRGCs and their intrinsic, melanopsin-based phototransduction. These synaptic inputs greatly expand the dynamic range and spectral bandpass of the non-image-forming visual functions for which ipRGCs provide the principal retinal input.},

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$>$}In this study we show a reproduction of the dress-ambiguity phenomenon in a real scene and we report quantitative measurements of the corresponding colour perceptions. The original, real dress, known from \#thedress-illusion, was illuminated by combined short- and longwavelength broadband lights from two slide projectors. Test subjects viewing the dress reported to perceive the dress fabric and lace colours as blue \&amp; black, white \&amp; gold or light blue \&amp; brown; their corresponding perceptual matches were distributed along the blue/yellow cardinal axis, and exhibited a variability comparable to the ambiguity of the dress photograph. It is particularly noteworthy that the colour ambiguity emerged despite explicit knowledge of the observers about the direction of the light source. Manipulating the background of the real dress (change in chromaticity and luminance, or masking) revealed significant differences between the perceptual groups regarding lightness and colour of the dress. Our findings suggest that observer specific differences in the perceptual organisation of the visual scene are responsible for the colour ambiguity observed for the real dress; in particular, we conclude that colour computations of white \&amp; gold viewers focused onto the local region of the dress, whereas the colour processes of blue \&amp; black and light-blue \&amp; brown viewers were strongly influenced by contextual computations including the background. Our segmentation hypothesis extends existing explanations for the dress ambiguity and proposes image based (in the case of the real scene) and high level (in the case of the photograph) neural processes which control the spatial reach of contextual colour computations. The relation between the ambiguity in our real scene and the dress photograph is discussed.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

Two observers adjusted the ratio of the two test lights to maintain an achromatic appearance under conditions of adaptation that varied with respect to background luminance, chromaticity and stimulus contrast. The shift in chromaticity of the achromatic point was in the direction of the chromaticity of the background, while the magnitude of the shift increased as an increasing function of background luminance and as a decreasing function of contrast. These data confirm and extend a model of chromatic adaptation that has the following properties: (1) non-additivity of transient test and steady background fields, in the sense that the background, although physically adding to the test flash, only affects its hue by way of altering the gain of cone pathways;(2) Vos-Walraven cone spectral sensitivities; and(3) adaptation sites in the cone pathways having the same action spectra as Stiles' {$\pi$}5, {$\pi$}4and (modified){$\pi$}1mechanisms, and which generate receptor-specific attenuation factors (von Kries Coefficients) according to Stiles' generalized threshold vs intensity function, {$\zeta$} (x).},

  abstract = {A new approach to identifying artifacts sensitive to visible light exposure, based on the direct measurement of the lightfastness of materials that compose the object, is described. An instrument has been constructed that is capable of identifying fugitive materials (more light sensitive than Blue Wool \#2) rapidly and essentially nondestructively. Accelerated light-fading tests on tiny (0.4 mm diameter) areas of an object are done while simultaneously monitoring the color change produced in the test area. The lightfastness determined in such microfading tests has been found to compare well with that measured in more conventional accelerated lightaging tests. The risks of damage to the artifacts from these microfading tests have been examined. By terminating the fading test when a small but definite color change has been produced, the risk of disfiguring the object by creating a visible bleached spot is judged to be very small. Exposure to the light intensities used in the microfading tester can heat test areas to as high as 50\textdegree C, so that low-melting materials such as waxes should be considered at risk of some degree of melting damage. For most art materials that are more heat tolerant, however, this technique holds great promise as a tool for recognizing very light-sensitive materials and for 'predicting the consequences of exhibition under particular lighting or atmospheric conditions.},

However, the type of high-threshold (HT) model used to derive this estimate is based on a number of assumptions that have been criticized in other experimental paradigms (e.g., visual search). Here we report findings from nine experiments in which VSTM for color, spatial frequency, and orientation was modeled using a signal detection theory (SDT) approach. In Experiments 1\textendash 6, two arrays composed of multiple stimulus elements were presented for 100 ms with a 1500 ms ISI. Observers were asked to report in a yes/no fashion whether there was any difference between the first and second arrays, and to rate their confidence in their response on a 1\textendash 4 scale. In Experiments 1\textendash 3, only one stimulus element difference could occur (T = 1) while set size was varied. In Experiments 4\textendash 6, set size was fixed while the number of stimuli that might change was varied (T = 1, 2, 3, and 4). Three general models were tested against the receiver operating characteristics generated by the six experiments. In addition to the HT model, two SDT models were tried: one assuming summation of signals prior to a decision, the other using a max rule. In Experiments 7\textendash 9, observers were asked to directly report the relevant feature attribute of a stimulus presented 1500 ms previously, from an array of varying set size. Overall, the results suggest that observers encode stimuli independently and in parallel, and that performance is limited by internal noise, which is a function of set size.},

An additional pair was prepared having very similar colour but with a chromaticity outside the range in which perception was reported to improve (`control' lenses). Each pair was provided for 1 month in random order. The children kept diaries (36 completed) recording symptoms of eye-strain and headache. The children and those responsible for their assessment were unable reliably to distinguish `experimental' from `control' lenses.

When using different physical stimuli across psychological conditions, one faces the problem of disentangling the contributions of low- and high-level factors. Here, we make available the SHINE (spectrum, histogram, and intensity normalization and equalization) toolbox for MATLAB, which we have found useful for controlling a number of image properties separately or simultaneously. The toolbox features functions for specifying the (rotational average of the) Fourier amplitude spectra, for normalizing and scaling mean luminance and contrast, and for exact histogram specification optimized for perceptual visual quality. SHINE can thus be employed for parametrically modifying a number of image properties or for equating them across stimuli to minimize potential low-level confounds in studies on higher level processes.},

  abstract = {Visual working memory capacity is greater for meaningful objects (e.g., trees) than both simple features (e.g., colors) and visually-matched meaningless stimuli (e.g., scrambled trees; e.g., Brady \&amp; St\"ormer, 2020). Here, we tested whether adding labels to ambiguous shape stimuli during encoding would improve subsequent memory performance for objects from the same category. Participants were shown three ambiguous shapes made from objects of the same category (e.g., three watches) for 1000ms, followed by a short delay period (1000ms) and a 2-AFC within-category discrimination test. In Experiment 1 (N=200), the shapes were black silhouettes of familiar objects that have been shown to be more recognizable when labels are provided (Koutstaal et al., 2003). In Experiment 2 (N=200), the shapes were warped images of real-world objects that were distorted just beyond recognition using the diffeomorphic scrambling technique (Stojanoski \&amp; Cusack, 2014). On each trial, half of the participants were prompted to ``remember these shapes'' and the other half were shown a category label (``remember these trees'') that could help participants recognize the shapes. In order to ensure participants did not rely on verbal strategies to perform the memory task itself, they rehearsed four digits out loud throughout each trial. Although we predicted the group that received the category labels would have better memory performance than the group that did not receive labels, memory performance (d') did not differ between groups in Experiment 1 (p=.37; BF01=4.35) or Experiment 2 (p=.60; BF01=5.72). This suggests that providing labels to support recognition of ambiguous shape stimuli during encoding does not allow them to be memorized with enough additional detail to improve subsequent within-category discriminability. In future work, we will test whether providing category labels improves memory performance for a within-category discrimination test when the memory set consists of more distinct objects (from different categories).}

One way to achieve this would be to construct a three-tiered cone mosaic with each class of photoreceptor in a different tier, much like color film. Each tier could then have the same spatial resolution as a single-tiered monochromatic mosaic and trichromacy could be incorporated without a loss of spatial resolution. The human cone mosaic, on the other hand, has its three cone submosaics interleaved in a. single tier. This means that on a small spatial scale the retina is not trichromatic since there can be only one spectral sample at each point in the retinal image. This chapter explores the cost for vision of incorporating trichromacy in a single-tiered cone mosaic.},

By fitting models to experimental data we can probe the algorithms underlying behavior, find neural correlates of computational variables and better understand the effects of drugs, illness and interventions. But with great power comes great responsibility. Here, we offer ten simple rules to ensure that computational modeling is used with care and yields meaningful insights. In particular, we present a beginner-friendly, pragmatic and details-oriented introduction on how to relate models to data. What, exactly, can a model tell us about the mind? To answer this, we apply our rules to the simplest modeling techniques most accessible to beginning modelers and illustrate them with examples and code available online. However, most rules apply to more advanced techniques. Our hope is that by following our guidelines, researchers will avoid many pitfalls and unleash the power of computational modeling on their own data.},

  abstract = {English and Russian color terms divide the color spectrum differently. Unlike English, Russian makes an obligatory distinction between lighter blues (``goluboy'') and darker blues (``siniy''). We investigated whether this linguistic difference leads to differences in color discrimination. We tested English and Russian speakers in a speeded color discrimination task using blue stimuli that spanned the siniy/goluboy border. We found that Russian speakers were faster to discriminate two colors when they fell into different linguistic categories in Russian (one siniy and the other goluboy) than when they were from the same linguistic category (both siniy or both goluboy). Moreover, this category advantage was eliminated by a verbal, but not a spatial, dual task. These effects were stronger for difficult discriminations (i.e., when the colors were perceptually close) than for easy discriminations (i.e., when the colors were further apart). English speakers tested on the identical stimuli did not show a category advantage in any of the conditions. These results demonstrate that (i) categories in language affect performance on simple perceptual color tasks and (ii) the effect of language is online (and can be disrupted by verbal interference).},

We examined the relationship between cortical folding and the location of the retinotopic maps hV4 and VO1, which are intermediate stages in the human ventral visual processing stream. Our data show a consistent arrangement of the eccentricity maps within hV4 and VO1 with respect to anatomy, with the consequence that the hV4/VO1 boundary is found consistently in the posterior transverse collateral sulcus (ptCoS) despite individual variability in map size and cortical folding. Understanding this relationship allowed us to predict the location of visual areas hV4 and VO1 in a separate set of individuals, using only their anatomies, with {$>$}85\% accuracy. These findings have important implications for understanding the relation between cortical folding and functional maps as well as for defining visual areas from anatomical landmarks alone.},

We tested whether pure red, yellow, green, and blue, (unique hues) coincide with troughs, and their transitions (binary hues) with peaks of sensitivity in DKL-space. Results partially confirmed this idea: JNDs demarcated perceptual categories at the binary hues around green, blue and less clearly around yellow, when colors were isoluminant with the background and when accounting for the overall variation of sensitivity by fitting an ellipse. The categorical JND pattern for those three categories was in line with the effect of the second-stage mechanisms. In contrast, the results for unique red, binary red-yellow, and the JNDs for dark colors clearly contradicted categorical perception. There was a JND maximum around the center of red and JNDs strongly decreased away from the center. Although this observation alone would also be in line with categorical perception; unique red was shifted away from the center towards yellow so that unique red was close to the minimum instead of the maximum JND, hence contradicting categorical perception. In addition, we also showed that observers do not adjust unique hues more consistently than binary hues, confirming a previous study. Taken together, our findings suggest that some of the unique hues could be inherent in the early stages of color processing. At the same time, they also raise questions about complex effects of lightness, chroma and instructions on the measurements of JNDs and unique hues.},

However, the main purpose of color perception is not to determine the properties of incident light, but to aid the visual perception of objects and materials in our environment. We review the state of the art on object colors, color constancy, and color categories to gain insight into the functional aspects of color perception. The common ground between these areas of research is that color appearance is tightly linked to the identification of objects and materials and the communication across observers. In conclusion, we argue that research should focus on how color processing is adapted to the surface properties of objects in the natural environment in order to bridge the gap between the known early stages of color perception and the subjective appearance of color.},

  abstract = {The origin of colour categories and their relationship to colour perception have been the prime example for testing the influence of language on perception and thought (Sapir-Whorf hypothesis) and more generally for investigating the biological, ecological and cultural determination of human cognition (nature-nurture debate). These themes are central to a broad range of disciplines, including vision research, neuroscience, cognitive psychology, developmental science, cultural anthropology, linguistics, computer science, and philosophy. Unfortunately, though, it has been tacitly taken for granted that the conceptual assumptions and methodological practices from the dawn of empirical research on colour categorisation are the gold standard for current colour category research. Here, we show that these assumptions and practices are obsolete and flawed and have led to four fundamental and widespread misconceptions about colour categorisation: 1.) that colour perception is inherently categorical; 2.) that English Basic Colour Terms correspond to universal categories that are the end point of a fixed evolutionary sequence; 3.) that the prototypes of English basic colour terms are perceptually salient and qualify as focal colours; and 4.) that colour category research essentially revolves around the universalism-realism debate. State-of-the-art research on colour categorisation provides new, more sophisticated approaches and allows for rectifying those four statements. At the same time, some of the questions underlying those statements are not convincingly answered yet and constitute major challenges to future research. The critical considerations on colour categorisation may be transferred to research on other kinds of perceptual categorisation to inspire new, more general research questions.},

  abstract = {The human retina contains five photoreceptor types: rods; short (S)-, mid (M)-, and long (L)-wavelength\textendash sensitive cones; and melanopsin-expressing ganglion cells. Recently, it has been shown that selective increments in M-cone activation are paradoxically perceived as brightness decrements, as opposed to L-cone increments. Here we show that similar effects are also observed in the pupillary light response, whereby M-cone or S-cone increments lead to pupil dilation whereas L-cone or melanopic illuminance increments resulted in pupil constriction. Additionally, intermittent photoreceptor activation increased pupil constriction over a 30-min interval. Modulation of L-cone or melanopic illuminance within the 0.25\textendash 4-Hz frequency range resulted in more sustained pupillary constriction than light of constant intensity. Opposite results were found for S-cone and M-cone modulations (2 Hz), mirroring the dichotomy observed in the transient responses. The transient and sustained pupillary light responses therefore suggest that S- and M-cones provide inhibitory input to the pupillary control system when selectively activated, whereas L-cones and melanopsin response fulfill an excitatory role. These findings provide insight into functional networks in the human retina and the effect of color-coding in nonvisual responses to light, and imply that nonvisual and visual brightness discrimination may share a common pathway that starts in the retina.},

  abstract = {The intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells (ipRGCs) provide a conduit through which rods and cones can access brain circuits mediating circadian entrainment, pupillary constriction and other non-image-forming visual functions. We characterized synaptic inputs to ipRGCs in rats using whole-cell and multielectrode array recording techniques. In constant darkness all ipRGCs received spontaneous excitatory and inhibitory synaptic inputs. Light stimulation evoked in all ipRGCs both synaptically driven ('extrinsic') and autonomous melanopsin-based ('intrinsic') responses. The extrinsic light responses were depolarizing, about 5 log units more sensitive than the intrinsic light response, and transient near threshold but sustained to brighter light. Pharmacological data showed that ON bipolar cells and amacrine cells make the most prominent direct contributions to these extrinsic light responses, whereas OFF bipolar cells make a very weak contribution. The spatial extent of the synaptically driven light responses was comparable to that of the intrinsic photoresponse, suggesting that synaptic contacts are made onto the entire dendritic field of the ipRGCs. These synaptic influences increase the sensitivity of ipRGCs to light, and also extend their temporal bandpass to higher frequencies. These extrinsic ipRGC light responses can explain some of the previously reported properties of circadian photoentrainment and other non-image-forming visual behaviours.},

  abstract = {Two white lights may have the same chromaticity, and yet when used to light an array of objects may differ in their ability to reveal colors. For example, any white light can be matched by a mixture of two narrow-band lights, a yellow plus a blue. In this extreme case, reds and greens become black or brown and the red-green dimension is lost. At the other extreme, a light with three narrow bands, at the proper wavelengths, can brighten reds and greens and increase red-green contrast, relative to a broad-band light such as daylight. Many commercial lights tend to dull reds and greens, relative to broad-band sources, a central reason that color rendering is a practical concern. A telling example is neodymium glass, a yellow-absorbing filter that is sometimes used to improve color rendering. This article seeks to bring these ideas to life through detailed graphical examples. \textcopyright{} 2003 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

  abstract = {Lights vary in their ability to render object spectral reflectances into color contrasts. When a light L1 is replaced by another L2, even if L2 matches L1 in chromaticity, systematic color shifts may occur, including a loss or gain of chromatic color. For instance, many familiar lights, when compared to daylight, dull red and green objects, rendering them closer to gray. An opponent colors method is appropriate to this discussion because it brings to the surface the notion of chromatic color, meaning actual departure from white or gray. In this article, an opponent-colors analysis leads to a matrix formulation that serves two purposes. The effects of replacing L1 by L2 are estimated with a 3\texttimes 3 ``rendering matrix'' P. Given an object's tristimulus vector under L1, the method makes an approximate prediction of the new tristimulus vector under L2. Thanks to the opponent formulation, matrix element P22 quantifies the gain or loss of redness and greenness, while P33 expresses gain or loss of blueness and yellowness. These in fact are major effects, so the method is both quantitative and explanatory. \textcopyright{} 2003 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

  abstract = {Starting with an opponent-colors formulation of color vision, two parameters, t\^i and d\^i, may be defined that express an illuminant's ability to realize red\textemdash green and blue\textemdash yellow contrasts of objects. For instance, calculation of t\^i and d\^i for daylight shows that on a gray day, color contrasts are actually reduced. By these measures, many common vapor-discharge illuminants systematically distort object colors. Because red-green contrasts contribute to border distinctness, and both types of color contrast contribute to brightness, such systematic distortions probably affect the overall clarity and brightness of what is perceived visually. Experimental data are consistent with this idea.In relation to color-constancy (retinex) experiments, it is approximately true that the visual system discounts the color of an illuminant but not its t\^i and d\^i.},

Examination of relevant empirical findings shows that claims about the unique hues which play a central role in the argument from phenomenal structure should be rejected. Chiefly, contrary to widespread belief amongst philosophers and scientists, the unique hues do not play a fundamental role in determining all color appearances. Among the consequences of this result is that greater attention should be paid to certain proposals for putting the structure of phenomenal color into principled correspondence with surface reflectance properties. While color realism is not fully vindicated, it has much greater empirical plausibility than previously thought.},

Colour memory on a delayed matching-to-sample (XAB) task was investigated in 2 language groups with differing colour lexicons, for 3 developmental stages and 2 regions of colour space. Analyses used a Bayesian technique to provide simultaneous assessment of two competing hypotheses (H1\textendash Whorfian effect present, H0\textendash Whorfian effect absent).

The present paper gives a geometrical interpretation of the theory directly in terms of the CIE chromaticity diagram, whereby without any computation it is possible to find the corresponding object-chromaticity point (x{${'}$},y{${'}$}). The basic data for such an interpretation are given, not only for adaptation to source A, but also for adaptation to any source whatever.},

  abstract = {Three new sets of color-matching experiments have been made by three observers binocularly viewing a bipartite field (each half subtending 3\textdegree ) of a three-primary colorimeter. Each set of color-matching data refers to 28 test colors scattered over the chromaticity gamut provided by the colorimeter. The luminance of each test color was 12 cd {$\cdot$} m-2; the white surround (subtending 40\textdegree ) was maintained at 6 cd {$\cdot$} m-2. The elliptical cross sections (for Y = const) of the observed color-matching ellipsoids are compared with results previously published by MacAdam, and Brown and MacAdam. In view of the inherent experimental uncertainties of data of this kind, the new color-matching ellipses correlate well with those obtained by Brown, and Brown and MacAdam, but show significant deviations from those obtained by MacAdam's observer P. G. Nutting, Jr. The discrepancies are puzzling. A note of caution is added with regard to the usefulness of color-matching ellipses in testing line elements. A set of color-matching ellipses can reveal only little of the visual mechanism that governs the precision of color matching and its assumed direct correlation with judging small color differences. It appears that fundamentally different line elements can reproduce almost equally well a given set of color-matching ellipses.},

  abstract = {Background Accurate skin colour measurements are important for numerous medical applications including the diagnosis and treatment of cutaneous disorders and the provision of maxillofacial soft tissue prostheses. Methods In this study, we obtained accurate skin colour measurements from four different ethnic groups (Caucasian, Chinese, Kurdish, Thai) and at four different body locations (Forehead, cheek, inner arm, back of hand) with a view of establishing a new skin colour database for medical and cosmetic applications. Skin colours are measured using a spectrophotometer and converted to a device-independent standard colour appearance space (CIELAB) where skin colour is expressed as values along the three dimensions: Lightness L*, Redness a* and Yellowness b*. Skin colour differences and variation are then evaluated as a function of ethnicity and body location. Results We report three main results: (1) When plotted in a standard colour appearance space (CIELAB), skin colour distributions for the four ethnic groups overlap significantly, although there are systematic mean differences. Between ethnicities, the most significant skin colour differences occur along the yellowness dimension, with Thai skin exhibiting the highest yellowness (b*) value and Caucasian skin the lowest value. Facial redness (a*) is invariant across the four ethnic groups. (2) Between different body locations, there are significant variations in redness (a*), with the forehead showing the highest redness value and the inner arm the lowest. (3) The colour gamut is smallest in the Chinese sample and largest in the Caucasian sample, with the Chinese gamut lying entirely the Caucasian gamut. Similarly, the largest variability in skin tones is found in the Caucasian group, and the smallest in the Chinese group. Conclusion Broadly speaking, skin colour variation can be explained by two main factors: individual differences in lightness and yellowness are mostly due to ethnicity, whereas differences in redness are primarily due to different body locations. Variations in lightness are more idiosyncratic probably reflecting the large influence of environmental factors such as exposure to sun.},

  abstract = {Color perception is a fundamental problem in perception because it is an example of how the visual system extracts invariant information about objects based on an ambiguous retinal image. Previous research on color perception mostly used two-dimensional scenes that consist of small numbers of flat surfaces under a uniform light source. In three-dimensional scenes, however, light reflected from an object's surface depends on its shape, pose, orientation, surface material property, and spatial location. In the face of uncertainty introduced by so many variables, can the previous findings about color constancy in simple scenes be used to generate predictions for 3D scenes? My thesis focused on studying the color perception of objects in three-dimensional scenes. The first part of my thesis consists of two experiments examining how the color appearance of 3D objects is affected by changes in object material properties. The first experiment examines the color perception of objects across variation in surface gloss. I found that observers do not simply match the average light reflected from the object's surface. Instead, the visual system compensates for the physical effect of varying gloss. The second experiment studies how people perceive color across locations on an object. I found the effect is small in comparison with the physical shift caused by the change in location. The second part of my thesis focused on color constancy of objects in complex scenes. In particular, I studied the effect of material properties on constancy of 3D objects. I found that the mean constancy index for 3D objects is lower than for 2D objects reported previously, but similar to what we measured for 2D objects in the current experiments. Constancy indices were significantly decreased when the reflectance of the background wall was inconsistent with the illuminant change. I observed that glossy materials have better constancy than matte materials when the illuminant is changed from Neutral to Yellow; but this was not true when the illuminant is changed from Neutral to Blue. Finally, I report preliminary experiments that examine the effect of depth, shape and local contrast on color constancy of objects in complex scenes.},

The properties of these hue-selective neurons have been studied extensively at the single-unit level, but it is unclear how stimulus hue is represented by the distribution of activity across neuronal populations in V1. Here we use the intrinsic optical signal to image V1 responses to spatially uniform stimuli of various hues. We found that (1) each of these stimuli activates an array of patches in the supragranular layers of the parafoveal V1; (2) the patches activated by different hues overlapped partially; 3) the peak locations of these patches were determined by stimulus hue. The peaks associated with various hues form well-separated clusters, in which nearby peaks represent perceptually similar hues. Each cluster represents a full gamut of hue in a small cortical area ( approximately 160 microm long). The hue order is preserved within each peak cluster, but the clusters have various geometrical shapes. These clusters were co-localized with regions that responded preferentially to chromatic gratings compared with achromatic ones. Our results suggest that V1 contains an array of hue maps, in which the hue of a stimulus is represented by the location of the peak response to the stimulus. The orderly, organized hue maps in V1, together with the recently discovered hue maps in the extrastriate cortical area V2, are likely to play an important role in hue perception in primates.},

Rather than using conventional direct or two-step processes, we transform camera RGB to skin reflectance directly using a principal component analysis (PCA) approach. The novelty in our direct method (RGB to spectra) is the use of a skin-specific colour characterisation chart with spectra closer to human skin spectra, and a new database of skin reflectances to derive the PCA bases. The experimental results using the facial images of 17 subjects demonstrate that our new direct method gives a significantly better performance than conventional, two-step methods and direct methods with traditional characterization charts. This new spectral reconstruction algorithm is sufficiently precise to reconstruct spectral properites relating to chromophores and its performance is within the acceptable range for maxillofacial soft tissue prostheses (error \&lt; 3 \&\#x0394;E*ab units).},

Studies on nonhuman primates or humans have suggested that these signals are combined in the striate cortex (V1) following a substantial amplification of the S-cone signals in the same area. In addition to reviewing these studies, this review describes the circuitry in V1 that may underlie the processing of the S-cone signals and the dynamics of this processing. It also relates the interaction between various cone signals in V1 to the results of some psychophysical and physiological studies on color perception, which leads to a discussion of a previous model, in which color perception is produced by a multistage processing of the cone signals. Finally, I discuss the processing of the S-cone signals in the extrastriate area V2.},

In this report, we propose a method indicating the color difference by blinking image pixels. The strength of blinking depends on the position of the object color on the confusion line, from which the color defectives can recognize level of the difference. As practical applications of the proposed method, we show a process to show grilling level of beef and ripeness level of tomatoes. The changes of spectral reflectances of beef and tomatoes were measured by a spectral luminance meter, and based upon them, we set appropriate parameters for blinking image pixels.},

  abstract = {In the retina, intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells (ipRGCs) which express photopigment melanopsin have been identified as photoreceptors which differ from cones and rods. It has been established that such melanopsin-expressing RGCs are involved in the circadian photo-entrainment and pupillary light reflexes. An additional projection from ipRGCs to the lateral geniculate nucleus has been identified, which indicates the association of ipRGCs with visual perception induced by the image-forming pathway. Reportedly, ipRGCs modulate brightness perception but quantitative analysis of brightness perception involving melanopsin and cones-based signals has not been elucidated. We conducted brightness perception experiments that involved melanopsin using a novel projector with six primary colors and formulated the results for melanopsin and cone stimuli. The white visual stimuli (5 degrees in size) that we used had a single xy-chromaticity values but melanopsin stimuli were modulated by designing different spectral distributions. Perceived brightness was measured using a magnitude estimation method at several luminance levels in the near periphery (7 degrees). Additionally, pupil diameter was measured for estimating the intensity of visual stimuli on the retina. The results showed that the perceived brightness of a white visual stimulus with different spectral distributions can be described by a summation of the nearly linear melanopsin response and the non-linear cone response with weighted coefficients, and the contribution ratio of melanopsin in brightness perception increased to 50\% and more with increasing visual stimulus. These suggest that melanopsin signals play a crucial role in the estimation of the absolute intensity of the light environment by obtaining absolute brightness information even when cones are adapted by light.},

  abstract = {Unique yellow is considered to represent the equilibrium point of the red-green opponent chromatic mechanism. There are several hypotheses that attempt to explain how this equilibrium point is established. The determinant for unique yellow, however, has not yet been clarified. Here we explored whether the L/M cone ratio or visual information determines unique yellow. If the former is the case, we expect that subjects with large differences in their L/M cone ratio would set different spectral lights to appear as unique yellow. The results of such an experiment, however, did not show a substantial difference in the value of unique yellow for two subjects with very different cone ratios. On the other hand, if the latter is the case, unique yellow should change when altering the chromaticity of the surrounding visual environment. To test this hypothesis, we conducted long-term adaptation experiments, in which subjects spent 8 to 12 hours in a chromatically altered environment. A significant shift of unique yellow was observed after spending time in such an environment for several days. These results indicate that the red-green opponent channel includes a plastic normalization mechanism that adjusts its balance point based on visual experience.},

  abstract = {Perceptual color space is continuous; however, we tend to divide it into only a small number of categories. It is unclear whether categorical color perception is obtained solely through the development of the visual system or whether it is affected by language acquisition. To address this issue, we recruited prelinguistic infants (5- to 7-mo-olds) to measure changes in brain activity in relation to categorical color differences by using near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS). We presented two sets of geometric figures to infants: One set altered in color between green and blue, and the other set altered between two different shades of green. We found a significant increase in hemodynamic responses during the between-category alternations, but not during the within-category alternations. These differences in hemodynamic response based on categorical relationship were observed only in the bilateral occipitotemporal regions, and not in the occipital region. We confirmed that categorical color differences yield behavioral differences in infants. We also observed comparable hemodynamic responses to categorical color differences in adults. The present study provided the first evidence, to our knowledge, that colors of different categories are represented differently in the visual cortex of prelinguistic infants, which implies that color categories may develop independently before language acquisition.},

  abstract = {Color perception of an object is tremendously influenced by the spectral power distribution (SPD) of a light source. Therefore, it is of great significance to seek for an optimal SPD to enhance the color contrast of a biological specimen in medical lighting. Meanwhile, considering that color rendering property and illuminance are of importance to lighting, with a multichannel LED light source and a differential evolution algorithm dealing with the constraints of color rendering and illuminance, a contrast enhancement method based on maximizing CIEDE2000 color difference ({$<$}inline-formula{$>$} {$<$}math display="inline" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"{$>$} {$<$}mrow{$>$} {$<$}mi mathvariant="normal"{$>\Delta<$}/mi{$>$} {$<$}msubsup{$>$} {$<$}mrow{$>$} {$<$}mi{$>$}E{$<$}/mi{$>$} {$<$}/mrow{$>$} {$<$}mrow{$>$} {$<$}mn{$>$}00{$<$}/mn{$>$} {$<$}/mrow{$>$} {$<$}mrow{$>$} {$<$}mo{$>$}*{$<$}/mo{$>$} {$<$}/mrow{$>$} {$<$}/msubsup{$>$} {$<$}/mrow{$>$} {$<$}/math{$>$} {$<$}/inline-formula{$>$}) was proposed in this study. An illuminance level of 500 lx was first verified as the desired illuminance. Afterward, the color contrasts of six groups of color patches were optimized under four different constraints of the Commission Internationale de l'Eclairage (CIE) general color rendering index (\emph{R}\textsubscript{a}), i.e., \emph{R}\textsubscript{a} {$\geq$} 0, \emph{R}\textsubscript{a} {$\geq$} 60, \emph{R}\textsubscript{a} {$\geq$} 80, and \emph{R}\textsubscript{a} {$\geq$} 90, manifesting their significant color contrast enhancement under the optimized light sources compared with those under the simulated CIE A, D50, D65, and D75 light sources. Further, two biological samples, pork tissues and porcine heart, were optimized under the four constraints of \emph{R}\textsubscript{a}. The results show that even in the case of \emph{R}\textsubscript{a} {$\geq$} 90, the optimized {$<$}inline-formula{$>$} {$<$}math display="inline" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"{$>$} {$<$}mrow{$>$} {$<$}mi mathvariant="normal"{$>\Delta<$}/mi{$>$} {$<$}msubsup{$>$} {$<$}mi{$>$}E{$<$}/mi{$>$} {$<$}mn{$>$}00{$<$}/mn{$>$} {$<$}mo{$>$}*{$<$}/mo{$>$} {$<$}/msubsup{$>$} {$<$}/mrow{$>$} {$<$}/math{$>$} {$<$}/inline-formula{$>$} values for the two specimens are, respectively, 4.13 and 3.20 higher than those under the D75 light source. More importantly, the developed method also provides a flexible lighting solution to color contrast enhancement.},

At the heart of our research lies a tractable task design that enabled us to reveal the signatures of probabilistic reasoning about latent structure. We found that a choice model based on the task's Bayesian ideal observer accurately matched many facets of human structural inference, including task performance, perceptual error patterns, single-trial responses, participant-specific differences, and subjective decision confidence\textemdash especially, when motion scenes were ambiguous and when object motion was hierarchically nested within other moving reference frames.

The models differ primarily in the physical process each makes use of as a cue to the illuminant. We evaluated whether the human visual system makes use of any of three of the following candidate illuminant cues: (1) specular highlight, (2) full surface specularity [Lee, H. C. (1986). Method for computing the scene-illuminant chromaticity from specular highlights. Journal of the Optical Society of America A, 3(10), 1694\textendash 1699; D'Zmura, M., \& Lennie, P. (1986). Mechanisms of color constancy. Journal of the Optical Society of America A, 3(10), 1662\textendash 1672], and (3) uniform background. Observers viewed simulated scenes binocularly in a computer-controlled Wheatstone stereoscope. All simulated scenes contained a uniform background plane perpendicular to the observer's line of sight and a small number of specular, colored spheres resting on the uniform background. Scenes were rendered under either standard illuminant D65 or standard illuminant A. Observers adjusted the color of a small, simulated test patch to appear achromatic. In a series of experiments we perturbed the illuminant color signaled by each candidate cue and looked for an influence of the changed cue on achromatic settings. We found that the specular highlight cue had a significant influence, but that the influence was asymmetric: greater when the base illuminant, CIE standard Illuminant A, was perturbed in the direction of Illuminant D65 than vice versa. Neither the full surface specularity cue nor the background cue had any observable influence. The lack of influence of the background cue is likely due to the placement of the test patch in front of the background rather than, as is typical, embedded in the background.},

  abstract = {Perceiving surfaces in a manner that accords with their physical properties is essential for successful behaviour. Since, however, a given retinal image can have been generated by an infinite variety of natural surfaces with different geometrical and/or physical qualities, the corresponding percepts cannot be determined by the stimulus per se. Rather, resolution of this quandary requires a strategy of vision that incorporates the statistical relationship of the information in retinal images to its sources in representative environments. To examine this probabilistic relationship with respect to the features of object surfaces, we analysed a database of range images in which the distances of all the objects in a series of natural scenes were measured with respect to the image plane by a laser range scanner. By taking any particular scene obtained in this way to be made up of a set of concatenated surface patches, we were able to explore the statistics of scene roughness, size\textendash distance relationships, surface orientation and local curvature, as well as the independent components of natural surfaces. The relevance of these statistics to both perception and the neuronal organization of the underlying visual circuitry is discussed.},

  abstract = {Our visual system can easily estimate the constant~color and material of external objects despite dynamic changes in the retinal image across viewpoints and illuminations in natural scenes. It is commonly believed that this high-level visual function, called "perceptual constancy," is acquired through postnatal learning [1], building upon low-level functions that have developed earlier, such as~image discrimination. However, we demonstrate here that before developing perceptual constancy, 3- to 4-month-old infants have a striking ability to discriminate slight image changes due to illumination that are not salient for adults. These young infants lose this ability after 5~months of age and then develop an ability to perceive distal surface properties (glossy or matte) at 7-8~months of age. Moreover, we identify the transition period between these two~functions at 5-6~months of age, wherein infants show difficulty in both image and surface discrimination. These findings support the notion that acquiring perceptual constancy leads to a loss of sensitivity to variant information, which is negligible for constant surface material perception. We suggest that the immature visual system may initially directly access local image features and then develops a complementary constant neural representation of the properties of an object.},

Here, we trained single network models to perform 20 cognitive tasks that depend on working memory, decision making, categorization, and inhibitory control. We found that after training, recurrent units can develop into clusters that are functionally specialized for different cognitive processes, and we introduce a simple yet effective measure to quantify relationships between single-unit neural representations of tasks. Learning often gives rise to compositionality of task representations, a critical feature for cognitive flexibility, whereby one task can be performed by recombining instructions for other tasks. Finally, networks developed mixed task selectivity similar to recorded prefrontal neurons after learning multiple tasks sequentially with a continual-learning technique. This work provides a computational platform to investigate neural representations of many cognitive tasks.},

Purity discrimination is best near 400 nm, least at 570 nm and intermediate at mid-spectrum and long wavelengths. A much flatter function occurs when colorimetric purity is measured as the first step from the spectrum toward white. In this study, we applied the formulation of chromatic discrimination thresholds measured along the S-cone and M/L-cone axis to account for chromatic discrimination in the equiluminant plane. The modeling results show that the purity step from white has a 1.6 log unit calculated range, similar to the classical data. The purity step from the spectrum is much flatter. The predicted range is dependent on the individual variance in chromatic discrimination thresholds and the luminance level. We then used psychophysical procedures to test the model's predictions. The resulting purity discrimination functions were generally in agreement with the model. Our modeling indicates that discrepant data of colorimetric purity can be explained with the context of discrimination models.},

A comparative analysis of within-scenes and between-scenes colourfulness assessments was performed. Images were created by varying chroma in the CIELUV colour space while lightness and hue-angle were kept constant. Experiment 1 shows the results of a multidimensional analysis of the differences-scaling in perceived colourfulness. Experiment 2 includes a unidimensional investigation of the direct-scaling of the magnitude of perceived colourfulness. Both experiments confirm that colourfulness judgments highly correlate with a linear combination of the mean of the distribution of chroma values and its standard deviation. That was also verified in Experiment 3 with ``Mondrian''-like stimuli (spatially scrambled versions of the images of natural scenes). Colourfulness judgments of natural scenes, but not ``Mondrian''-like scenes, brought out systematic differences between observers. In order to interpret and quantify these differences, a model of individual strategies in colourfulness judgments is developed and discussed.},

We introduce a model for optimal color reproduction of natural scenes which is based on the assumption that color quality of natural images is constrained by perceived naturalness and colorfulness of these images. To verify the model, a few experimentswere carried out where subjects estimated the perceived `naturalness', `colorfulness' and `quality' of images of natural scenes. The judgments were related to statistical parameters of the color point distribution across the images in the CIELUV color space. It was found that the perceptually optimal color reproduction can be derived from this statistic within the framework of our model. We specify naturalness, colorfulness and quality indices, describing the observer's judgments. Finally, an algorithm for optimizing perceived quality of color reproduction of natural scenes is discussed.},

Although color appears to be a salient attribute of faces, past research has suggested that it confers little recognition advantage for identifying people. Here we report experimental results suggesting that color cues do play a role in face recognition and their contribution becomes evident when shape cues are degraded. Under such conditions, recognition performance with color images is significantly better than that with gray-scale images. Our experimental results also indicate that the contribution of color may lie not so much in providing diagnostic cues to identity as in aiding low-level image-analysis processes such as segmentation.},

  abstract = {{$<$}h3{$>$}Summary{$<$}/h3{$>$} {$<$}p{$>$}For colour vision, retinal circuits must separate information about intensity and wavelength. This requires circuit-level comparison of at least two spectrally distinct photoreceptors. However, many vertebrates use four or more, and in those cases the nature and implementation of this computation remains poorly understood. Here, we establish the complete circuit architecture and function of outer retinal circuits underlying colour processing in the tetrachromatic larval zebrafish. Our findings reveal that the specific spectral tunings of the four cone types near optimally rotate the encoding of natural daylight in a principal component analysis (PCA)-like manner to yield one primary achromatic axis, two colour-opponent axes as well as a secondary UV-achromatic axis for prey capture. We note that fruit flies \textendash{} the only other tetrachromat species where comparable circuit-level information is available - use essentially the same strategy to extract spectral information from their relatively blue-shifted terrestrial visual world. Together, our results suggest that rotating colour space into achromatic and chromatic axes at the eye's first synapse may be a fundamental principle of colour vision when using more than two spectrally well-separated photoreceptor types.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

The basic colors (8 chromatic and 3 achromatic) are situated in specific locations of color space, suggesting a fixed relationship between specific hue and luminance. To determine the physiologic origins of the basic colors, we have studied the responses of cells in visual cortical areas V1, V2 and V4 of the behaving macaque monkey, using chromatic and achromatic stimuli of varying luminance. A total of 569 cells (291 from V1, 205 from V2, 73 from V4) were obtained, and classified as `B' (bright; 43\textendash 50\% of the total cells in each area), `D' (dark; 6\textendash 12\% of the total), and `BD' (bright/dark; 27\textendash 28\% of the total) color or non-color cells according to each cell's color/luminance preference in relation to the neutral gray background. About two thirds of `B' cells in each area were color specific, whereas the proportion of color cells in `BD' and `D' categories was lower. In all three areas (V1, V2, V4), color cells with preferences for midspectral colors (such as yellow, lime and green) also preferred high luminance levels, while color cells with preferences for endspectral colors (such as red and blue) responded preferentially to luminance levels closer to background. The data provide evidence for categorical color perception within the visual system, as well as providing a physiological basis for the increased saliency of endspectral contours observed at equiluminance in psychophysical studies.},

  abstract = {Working memory is imprecise, and these imprecisions can be explained by the combined influences of random diffusive error and systematic drift toward a set of stable states (``attractors''). However, the neural correlates of diffusion and drift remain unknown. Here, we investigated how delay-period activity in frontal and parietal cortex, which is known to correlate with the decline in behavioral memory precision observed with increasing memory load, might relate to diffusion and drift. We analyzed data from an existing experiment in which subjects performed delayed recall for line orientation, at different loads, during functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scanning. To quantify the influence of drift and diffusion, we modeled subjects' behavior using a discrete attractor model and calculated within-subject correlation between frontal and parietal delay-period activity and whole-trial estimates of drift and diffusion. We found that although increases in frontal and parietal activity were associated with increases in both diffusion and drift, diffusion explained the most variance in frontal and parietal delay-period activity. In comparison, a subsequent whole-brain regression analysis showed that drift, rather than diffusion, explained the most variance in delay-period activity in lateral occipital cortex. These results are consistent with a model of the differential recruitment of general frontoparietal mechanisms in response to diffusive noise and of stimulus-specific biases in occipital cortex.},

Here, we combined choice-correlation measures and electrical microstimulation on a site-to-site basis in the medial superior temporal area (MST), middle temporal area (MT), and ventral intraparietal area (VIP) when macaques discriminated between motion directions in both fine and coarse tasks. Microstimulation generated comparable effects between tasks but heterogeneous effects across and within brain regions. Within the MST and MT, microstimulation significantly biased an animal's choice toward the sensory preference instead of choice-related signals of the stimulated units. This was particularly evident for sites with conflict preference of sensory and choice-related signals. In the VIP, microstimulation failed to produce significant effects in either task despite strong choice correlations presented in this area. Our results suggest that sensory readout may not be inferred from choice-related signals during perceptual decision-making tasks.},

Because color is abstract, this difficulty has been attributed to challenges in integrating over heterogeneous objects to discover color as a dimension of reference. On this account, learning that color words refer to the color dimension is slow, but subsequently mapping these words to particular shades is fast. Recent work suggests an alternative: Children may rapidly identify color as a referential dimension, but only gradually discover the precise boundaries of each color word. This alternative proposal predicts that the learning mechanisms underlying the acquisition of color words should parallel those underlying the acquisition of concrete object categories. We test this prediction, finding that children's performance in a color naming task is modulated by three factors that have previously been studied in category learning: input frequency, category size, and perceptual salience. Because it allows for precise psychophysical measurement of category properties, color presents a unique case study for investigating language acquisition and categorization more broadly.},

We present experimental evidence that opponent-color signals interact after joint modulation even though they are essentially independent under neutral steady adaptation and after exclusive modulation of each mechanism. In addition, prolonged modulation linearizes the response function of each mechanism. The changes in interaction serve to orthogonalize opponent signals with respect to the adapting modulation, and the changes in response functions serve to equalize the relative frequencies of different levels of response to the adapting modulation. Adaptive orthogonalization reduces sensitivity to the adapting color direction, improves sensitivity to the orthogonal direction, and predicts shifts in color appearance. Response equalization enhances effective contrast and explains the difference between the effects of adaptation to uniform versus temporally or spatially modulated stimuli.},

Primates have image-focusing eyes with three classes of cones, and decode color further along the visual-processing hierarchy.

Afterimages were important in disproving the theory that visual rays emanate from the eye, in demonstrating interocular interactions, and in revealing the independence of binocular vision from eye movements. Afterimages also prove invaluable in exploring selective attention, filling in, and consciousness. Proposed physiological mechanisms for color afterimages range from bleaching of cone photopigments to cortical adaptation [4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9], but direct neural measurements have not been reported. We introduce a time-varying method for evoking afterimages, which provides precise measurements of adaptation and a direct link between visual percepts and neural responses [10]. We then use in~vivo electrophysiological recordings to show that all three classes of primate retinal ganglion cells exhibit subtractive adaptation to prolonged stimuli, with much slower time constants than those expected of photoreceptors. At the cessation of the stimulus, ganglion cells generate rebound responses that can provide afterimage signals for later neurons. Our results indicate that afterimage signals are generated in the retina but may be modified like other retinal signals by cortical processes, so that evidence presented for cortical generation of color afterimages is explainable by spatiotemporal factors that modify all signals.},

These responses are driven primarily by stimulation of photosensitive retinal ganglion cells (pRGCs) that are most sensitive to short-wavelength ({$\sim$}480 nm) blue light and remain functional in the absence of rods and cones [8\textendash 10]. We examined the spectral sensitivity of non-image-forming responses in two profoundly blind subjects lacking functional rods and cones (one male, 56 yr old; one female, 87 yr old). In the male subject, we found that short-wavelength light preferentially suppressed melatonin, reset the circadian pacemaker, and directly enhanced alertness compared to 555 nm exposure, which is the peak sensitivity of the photopic visual system. In an action spectrum for pupillary constriction, the female subject exhibited a peak spectral sensitivity ({$\lambda$}max) of 480 nm, matching that of the pRGCs but not that of the rods and cones. This subject was also able to correctly report a threshold short-wavelength stimulus ({$\sim$}480 nm) but not other wavelengths. Collectively these data show that pRGCs contribute to both circadian physiology and rudimentary visual awareness in humans and challenge the assumption that rod- and cone-based photoreception mediate all ``visual'' responses to light.},

We describe how probabilistic models coupled with fMRI-guided microelectrode recordings from inferior-temporal macaque cortex (IT) could help us understand color decoding: i.e. how appearance is extracted from the neuronal responses evoked by a stimulus. Neurons in IT respond to a narrow range of colors with their peak responses scattered around the color circle.

  abstract = {Illuminant estimation algorithms are often evaluated by calculating recovery angular error which is the angle between the RGB of the ground truth and the estimated illuminants. However, the same scene viewed under two different lights with respect to which the same algorithm delivers illuminant estimates and then identical reproductions-and so, the practical estimation error is the same-can, in fact and counterintuitively, result in quite different recovery errors. Reproduction angular error has been recently introduced as an improvement to recovery angular error. The new metric calculates the angle between the RGB values of a white surface corrected by the ground truth illuminant and corrected by the estimated illuminant. Experiments show that illumi-nant estimation algorithms could be ranked differently depending on whether they are evaluated by recovery or reproduction angular error. In this paper a psychophysical experiment is designed which demonstrates that observers choices on 'what makes a good reproduction' correlates with reproduction error and not recovery error.}

  abstract = {We derive a principled information-theoretic account of cross-language semantic variation. Specifically, we argue that languages efficiently compress ideas into words by optimizing the information bottleneck (IB) trade-off between the complexity and accuracy of the lexicon. We test this proposal in the domain of color naming and show that (i) color-naming systems across languages achieve near-optimal compression; (ii) small changes in a single trade-off parameter account to a large extent for observed cross-language variation; (iii) efficient IB color-naming systems exhibit soft rather than hard category boundaries and often leave large regions of color space inconsistently named, both of which phenomena are found empirically; and (iv) these IB systems evolve through a sequence of structural phase transitions, in a single process that captures key ideas associated with different accounts of color category evolution. These results suggest that a drive for information-theoretic efficiency may shape color-naming systems across languages. This principle is not specific to color, and so it may also apply to cross-language variation in other semantic domains.},

  abstract = {A subject's response to the strength of a stimulus is described by the psychometric function, from which summary measures, such as a threshold or a slope, may be derived. Traditionally, this function is estimated by fitting a parametric model to the experimental data, usually the proportion of successful trials at each stimulus level. Common models include the Gaussian and Weibull cumulative distribution functions. This approach works well if the model is correct, but it can mislead if not. In practice, the correct model is rarely known. Here, a nonparametric approach based on local linear fitting is advocated. No assumption is made about the true model underlying the data, except that the function is smooth. The critical role of the bandwidth is identified, and its optimum value is estimated by a cross-validation procedure. As a demonstration, seven vision and hearing data sets were fitted by the local linear method and by several parametric models. The local linear method frequently performed better and never worse than the parametric ones.

  abstract = {We used the Land Colour Mondrian experiments in a Bayesian context to test the degree to which subjects vary in categorizing the colour of different patches, when each patch is made to reflect light of the identical wavelength-energy composition. The brain uses a ratio-taking mechanism to determine the ratio of light of every waveband reflected from a surface and from its surrounds. Our (Bayesian) hypothesis was that this ratio-taking mechanism is similar in all humans and therefore leads to a constant categorization of colours that differs little between them. The similarly categorized colours are the initial priors, with initial hues attached to them. Twenty subjects of different ethnic and cultural backgrounds, for all but one of whom English was not the primary language, viewed eight patches of different colour in two Mondrian displays; each patch, when viewed, was made to reflect identical ratios of long-, middle- and short-wave light. Subjects were asked to match the colour of the viewed patch with that of the Munsell chip coming closest in colour to that of the viewed patch, without using language. In terms of hue, there was less variability in matching warm hues than cool ones. In terms of colour categorization, there was little variability overall. We take the lack of significant variability between subjects in the matches made as a pointer to similar computational mechanisms being employed in different subjects to perceive colours, thus permitting them to assume that their categorization of colours has universal agreement and assent.},

Wavelength-selective and wavelength-opponent cells were found to be very sensitive to changes in the wavelength composition of the light reflected from the areas in their receptive fields, irrespective of their perceived natural and void colours. 8 Changes in the wavelength composition of the light reflected from surrounding areas did not affect their responses. They were also sensitive to the order in which lights of various wavelengths illuminated the areas in their receptive fields. Colour-coded cells were not affected by changes in the wavelength composition nor were they sensitive to the sequence with which the area in their receptive fields was illuminated by lights of different wavelengths. However, they required that the display, with the area of their preferred colour in their receptive fields, be trichromatically illuminated. This and other evidence suggested that such cells were sensitive not only to the illumination of the area in their receptive fields, but of surrounding areas as well. This evidence reinforces further the distinction between wavelength-selective and colour-coded cells and leads to the conclusion that one function of the wavelength-selective cells must be to register the changes in wavelength composition which occur throughout the day.},

B. 47, 23\textendash 58] to learn whether color constancy mechanisms are intact in him, which amounts to learning whether he can assign a constant color to a surface in spite of changes in the precise wavelength composition of the light reflected from that surface. We supplemented our psychophysical studies with imaging ones, using functional magnetic resonance, to learn something about the location of areas that are active in his brain when he perceives colors. The psychophysical results suggested that color constancy mechanisms are severely defective in PB and that his color vision is wavelength-based. The imaging results showed that, when he viewed and recognized colors, significant increases in activity were restricted mainly to V1-V2. We conclude that a partly defective color system operating on its own in a severely damaged brain is able to mediate a conscious experience of color in the virtually total absence of other visual abilities.},

It is unknown if ipRGC activity is subject to extrinsic (central) or intrinsic (retinal) network-mediated circadian modulation during light entrainment and phase shifting. Eleven younger persons (18\textendash 30 years) with no ophthalmological, medical or sleep disorders participated. The activity of the inner (ipRGC) and outer retina (cone photoreceptors) was assessed hourly using the pupil light reflex during a 24 h period of constant environmental illumination (10 lux). Exogenous circadian cues of activity, sleep, posture, caffeine, ambient temperature, caloric intake and ambient illumination were controlled. Dim-light melatonin onset (DLMO) was determined from salivary melatonin assay at hourly intervals, and participant melatonin onset values were set to 14 h to adjust clock time to circadian time. Here we demonstrate in humans that the ipRGC controlled post-illumination pupil response has a circadian rhythm independent of external light cues. This circadian variation precedes melatonin onset and the minimum ipRGC driven pupil response occurs post melatonin onset. Outer retinal photoreceptor contributions to the inner retinal ipRGC driven post-illumination pupil response also show circadian variation whereas direct outer retinal cone inputs to the pupil light reflex do not, indicating that intrinsically photosensitive (melanopsin) retinal ganglion cells mediate this circadian variation.},

We show that brightness estimations for each primary light follow an approximately linear increase with increasing cone or melanopsin luminance (in log units), but are not equivalent for primary lights equated with either cone or melanopsin luminance. Instead, brightness estimations result from a combined interaction between cone and melanopsin signaling. Analytical modeling with wavelength-dependent coefficients signifies that melanopsin luminance positively correlates with brightness magnitudes, and the cone luminance has two contribution components, one that is additive to melanopsin luminance and a second that is negative, implying an adaptation process. These results provide a new framework for evaluating the physiological basis of brightness perception and have direct practical applications for the development of energy-efficient light sources.},

  abstract = {Background: Retinal photoreceptors provide the main stage in the mammalian eye for regulating the retinal illumination through changes in pupil diameter, with a small population of melanopsin-expressing intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells (ipRGCs) forming the primary afferent pathway for this response. The purpose of this study is to determine how melanopsin interacts with the three cone photoreceptor classes in the human eye to modulate the light-adapted pupil response. Methods: We investigated the independent and combined contributions of the inner and outer retinal photoreceptor inputs to the afferent pupil pathway in participants with trichromatic colour vision using a method to independently control the excitations of ipRGCs, cones and rods in the retina. Results: We show that melanopsin-directed stimuli cause a transient pupil constriction generated by cones in the shadow of retinal blood vessels; desensitising these penumbral cone signals uncovers a signature melanopsin pupil response that includes a longer latency and slower velocity to constriction than for cone-directed stimuli, and which remains sustained post-stimulus offset. Compared to melanopsin-mediated pupil responses, the cone photoreceptor-initiated pupil responses are more transient with faster constriction latencies, higher velocities and a secondary constriction at light offset. The combined pupil responses reveal that melanopsin signals are additive with the cone signals. Conclusions: The visual system uses the L-, M, and S-cone photoreceptor inputs to the afferent pupil pathway to accomplish the tonic modulations of pupil size to changes in image contrast. The inner retinal melanopsin-expressing ipRGCs mediate the longer-term, sustained pupil constriction to set the light-adapted pupil diameter during extended light exposures.},

Twenty-four observers of different gender and educational background participated to evaluate oil and gouache paintings under different lighting conditions. Each painting was assessed via 14 word pairs using the categorical judgment method. The results showed that illuminance had a larger impact than CCT on visual perception, and three factors dominate visual perceptions: Comfort, Vividness and Definition. The present results only partially agreed with Kruithof's rule. A comfort zone of illuminance and CCT for paintings in museums has been developed.},

We investigated the means by which sustained light responses are evoked in DA neurons. Sustained light responses were driven by cationic currents and persisted in vitro and in vivo in the presence of L-AP4, a blocker of retinal ON-bipolar cells. Several characteristics of these L-AP4-resistant light responses suggested that they were driven by melanopsin-expressing intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells (ipRGCs), including long latencies, marked poststimulus persistence, and a peak spectral sensitivity of 478 nm. Furthermore, sustained DA neuron light responses, but not transient DA neuron responses, persisted in rod/cone degenerate retinas, in which ipRGCs account for virtually all remaining retinal phototransduction. Thus, ganglion-cell photoreceptors provide excitatory drive to DA neurons, most likely by way of the coramification of their dendrites and the processes of DA neurons in the inner plexiform layer. This unprecedented centrifugal outflow of ganglion-cell signals within the retina provides a novel basis for the restructuring of retinal circuits by light.},

Wolbachia               infection can regulate host reproduction with the most common phenotype in insects being cytoplasmic incompatibility (CI), which results in embryonic lethality when uninfected eggs fertilized with sperms from infected males. This suggests that CI-induced defects are mainly in paternal side. However, whether               Wolbachia               -induced metabolic changes play a role in the mechanism of paternal-linked defects in embryonic development is not known. In the current study, we first use untargeted metabolomics method with LC-MS to explore how               Wolbachia               infection influences the metabolite profiling of the insect hosts. The untargeted metabolomics revealed 414 potential differential metabolites between               Wolbachia-               infected and uninfected 1-day-old (1d) male flies. Most of the differential metabolites were significantly up-regulated due to               Wolbachia               infection. Thirty-four metabolic pathways such as carbohydrate, lipid and amino acid, and vitamin and cofactor metabolism were affected by               Wolbachia               infection. Then, we applied targeted metabolomics analysis with GC-MS and showed that               Wolbachia               infection resulted in an increased energy expenditure of the host by regulating glycometabolism and fatty acid catabolism, which was compensated by increased food uptake. Furthermore, overexpressing two acyl-CoA catabolism related genes,               Dbi               (coding for diazepam-binding inhibitor) or               Mcad               (coding for medium-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase), ubiquitously or specially in testes caused significantly decreased paternal-effect egg hatch rate. Oxidative stress and abnormal mitochondria induced by               Wolbachia               infection disrupted the formation of sperm nebenkern. These findings provide new insights into mechanisms of               Wolbachia               -induced paternal defects from metabolic phenotypes.},

Then the principal components were further extended from three to nine through the residual spectral error of the reflectance in each subgroup. For each target sample, the extended principal components of the corresponding subgroup samples were used in the common PCA method to reconstruct the spectral reflectance.

  abstract = {In this paper, we propose a novel model for the computational color constancy, inspired by the amazing ability of the human vision system (HVS) to perceive the color of objects largely constant as the light source color changes. The proposed model imitates the color processing mechanisms in the specific level of the retina, the first stage of the HVS, from the adaptation emerging in the layers of cone photoreceptors and horizontal cells (HCs) to the color-opponent mechanism and disinhibition effect of the non-classical receptive field in the layer of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs). In particular, HC modulation provides a global color correction with cone-specific lateral gain control, and the following RGCs refine the processing with iterative adaptation until all the three opponent channels reach their stable states (i.e., obtain stable outputs). Instead of explicitly estimating the scene illuminant(s), such as most existing algorithms, our model directly removes the effect of scene illuminant. Evaluations on four commonly used color constancy data sets show that the proposed model produces competitive results in comparison with the state-of-the-art methods for the scenes under either single or multiple illuminants. The results indicate that single opponency, especially the disinhibitory effect emerging in the receptive field's subunit-structured surround of RGCs, plays an important role in removing scene illuminant(s) by inherently distinguishing the spatial structures of surfaces from extensive illuminant(s).},

  abstract = {Key points Intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells (ipRGCs) are a rare population of retinal output neurons that drives subconscious physiological responses to light, e.g. pupillary constriction, synchronization of daily rhythms to the light\textendash dark cycle and regulation of hormone secretion. This study investigated the functional diversity among the five known types of ipRGCs, named M1\textendash M5. We found that M2\textendash M5 cells could detect spatial differences in light intensity, implicating an ability to analyse the form of visual stimuli. All five ipRGC types responded robustly to moving lights, and M1\textendash M4 cells appeared to respond optimally to different speeds, suggesting they might analyse the speed of motion. M1\textendash M4 cells were shown to project to the superior colliculus, a brain area known to detect novel objects in the visual scene, suggesting that the form and motion information signalled by these four types of ipRGCs could contribute to this visual function. Abstract Intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells (ipRGCs) mediate non-image-forming visual responses, including pupillary constriction, circadian photoentrainment and suppression of pineal melatonin secretion. Five morphological types of ipRGCs, M1\textendash M5, have been identified in mice. In order to understand their functions better, we studied the photoresponses of all five cell types, by whole-cell recording from fluorescently labelled ipRGCs visualized using multiphoton microscopy. All ipRGC types generated melanopsin-based (`intrinsic') as well as synaptically driven (`extrinsic') light responses. The intrinsic photoresponses of M1 cells were lower threshold, higher amplitude and faster than those of M2\textendash M5. The peak amplitudes of extrinsic light responses differed among the ipRGC types; however, the responses of all cell types had comparable thresholds, kinetics and waveforms, and all cells received rod input. While all five types exhibited inhibitory amacrine-cell and excitatory bipolar-cell inputs from the `on' channel, M1 and M3 received additional `off'-channel inhibition, possibly through their `off'-sublamina dendrites. The M2\textendash M5 ipRGCs had centre\textendash surround-organized receptive fields, implicating a capacity to detect spatial contrast. In contrast, the receptive fields of M1 cells lacked surround antagonism, which might be caused by the surround of the inhibitory input nullifying the surround of the excitatory input. All ipRGCs responded robustly to a wide range of motion speeds, and M1\textendash M4 cells appeared tuned to different speeds, suggesting that they might analyse the speed of motion. Retrograde labelling revealed that M1\textendash M4 cells project to the superior colliculus, suggesting that the contrast and motion information signalled by these cells could be used by this sensorimotor area to detect novel objects and motion in the visual field.},

In this paper, we proposed two pixel-wise algorithms to achieve relative color constancy by working under the spectral domain. That is, the proposed algorithms map each pixel to the reflectance ratio of objects appeared in the scene and perform illumination correction in this spectral domain. Also, we proposed a camera calibration technique that calculates the characteristics of a camera without the need of a standard reference. We show that both of the proposed algorithms achieved the best performance on nonuniform illumination correction and relative illumination matching respectively compared to the benchmarked algorithms.},

It is unclear whether there are separate attentional resources modulating the chromatic processes in these pathways. Here, we examined the attentional modulation effects on chromatic contrast discrimination with chromaticities along the \$l\$l or \$s\$s cardinal axis on a cone chromaticity space for preferentially stimulating either the inferred PC or KC pathway, respectively. A dual-task interference paradigm was used, and chromatic contrast discrimination sensitivities under dual-task conditions were compared with that under a single-task condition. The results revealed that compared with the single-task condition, attending to a competing central task in the dual-task condition decreased the peripheral discrimination sensitivity in both chromatic cardinal axes, and sensitivity reduced regardless of whether the dual tasks were along the same or different chromatic cardinal axes. These findings indicate that attentional effects on chromatic processes are not specific to the cardinal axis, suggesting that the PC and KC pathways may share a common attention resource in modulating chromatic processing.},

  abstract = {This work is intended to deal with the problems which arise when illuminanting Paleolithic cave paintings. We have carried out the spectral and colorimetric characterization of some paintings located in the Murcielagos (bats) cave (Zuheros, C\~A\^A{$^3$}rdoba, Spain). From this characterization, the chromatic changes produced under different lighting conditions are analysed. The damage function is also computed for the different illuminants used. From the results obtained, it is proposed an illuminant whose spectral distribution diminishes the damage by minimizing the absorption of radiation and optimises the color perception of the paintings in this cave. The procedure followed in this study can be applied to optimise the lighting systems used when illuminating any other art work}

In this paper, we show that computational techniques\textemdash even simple ones that are straightforward to use\textemdash can greatly facilitate designing, implementing, and analyzing experiments, and generally help lift research to a new level. We focus on the domain of artificial grammar learning, and we give five concrete examples in this domain for (a) formalizing and clarifying theories, (b) generating stimuli, (c) visualization, (d) model selection, and (e) exploring the hypothesis space.},
