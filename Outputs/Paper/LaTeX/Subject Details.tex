Data were collected in four adult male rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta)(“PO, CA, BU, and MO”) weighing 8–10 kg. 
All experimental procedures were approved by the Animal Care and Use Committee of the National Eye Institute and complied with the regulations of the National Institutes of Health. 
Plastic headposts were mounted with sterile surgical procedures, using procedures described in detail elsewhere \citep{lafer-sousa_parallel_2013}. 
The animals were acclimatized with positive reinforcement to sit in a custom-made chair positioned with the eyes 70cm in front of a computer monitor and to perform visual tasks as described below. 
At the beginning of each testing session, we positioned a mouthpiece to deliver fluid reward to the animal. 
An infra-red camera was directed at the eye to monitor eye position with the ISCAN system. 
The precision of the eye tracking was \textbackslash0.3 degrees.
