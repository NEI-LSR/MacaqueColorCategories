Data were collected in four adult male rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta)(“PO, CA, BU, and MO”) weighing 8–10 kg. All experimental procedures were approved by the Animal Care and Use Committee of the National Eye Institute and complied with the regulations of the National Institutes of Health. Plastic headposts were mounted with sterile surgical procedures, using procedures described in detail elsewhere {Lafer-Sousa, 2013 \#6318}. The animals were acclimatized with positive reinforcement to sit in a custom-made chair positioned with the eyes 57 cm in front of a computer monitor and to perform visual tasks as described below.
