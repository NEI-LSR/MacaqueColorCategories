\paragraph{Longitudinal analysis}

Segmenting our data into subgroups of 5000 datapoints allowed us to both look at whether the determined categories varied over time, and also allowed us to perform a power analysis. From the monkeys studied it was clear that during our data collection period the categories remained static (within our measurement uncertainty), and also that the categories we saw are reliable enough to be seen with substantially less data.
