Important because Sapir Whorf* (is there a standard set of biologically driven color categories? By looking at an animal without language we can get some idea), and also the concept of categorization (and language?) being computationally valuable as an 'internal language' (Shepard**).

In previous papers that looked at color categories in macaques they found that they could *learn* categories (need to check this) but not whether they inherently used them.

In Bae+ 2015 they could ask what the color category centres were, and base their analysis on this. We can't ask the monkeys, and so we need an analysis method that doesn't rely on this. We also want to avoid (consciously or accidentally) *teaching* the monkeys categories.

* Actually this isn't quite Sapir Whorf - that is looking at whether language shapes your experience, whereas I/we are interested in whether there is a universal basis for color categories. This interacts though, because if there *is* a universal basis then this puts a limit on the extent to which color is different across languages. Color has long been used as a test case for the Sapir Whorf hypothesis because it ~is~ has been deemed as 'arbitrary' categorization of a continuous variable (I think that's the reason, check with Bevil/Bevil's papers)

** I should ~read~ look through that book on categorization I have.
