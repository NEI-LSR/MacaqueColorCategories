### Title slide

Hi, I'm Danny Garside and I'm a postdoc in the lab of Bevil Conway at the National Institutes of Health in the USA. I'm really excited to be here -- I've been attending this event since I was an undergraduate and it's an honour to finally be presenting.

Before I start, I'd like to acknowledge the team that I've been working on this project with, in particular the postbacs who have collected a lot of the data, and developed many of the analyses that I'm presenting today: Audrey Chang, Hannah Selwyn, and Shriya Awasthi.

### Human vs macaque

Our lab uses color as a model system to understand how the brain makes perception and thought happen. One long-term goal is to understand the responsible neural and circuit level mechanisms. To that end, we rely on macaque monkeys in which we can use invasive techniques such as micro-electrode recording that we cannot readily deploy in humans. But if we're to translate what we learn from electrode recording to humans, we need a firm understanding of the behavioural similarities and differences between humans and macaques. So an important piece of our work involves running comparable behavioural tests in monkeys that have been used in humans.

### Different levels of color

An attractive feature of color as a model system is that it encompasses perceptual and cognitive phenomena that range from seemingly low-level behaviours such as detection, to mid-level behaviours such as categorization, and higher-level behaviours such as memory and reward. Today, I'm going to focus on our recent and on-going work investigating whether monkeys have colour categories, but first I'll give a brief overview of our lab's prior work comparing color behaviour in monkeys and humans, to set the stage.

### Receptoral

Macaque monkeys have a very similar front-end of their color system compared to humans---they have essentially the same trichromatic retina, comprising three cone photoreceptors with the same spectral tuning as our L, M, and S opsins.

### Post-receptoral

In our previous work, we tested the extent to which monkeys and humans have similar post-receptoral mechanisms, adapting the classic paradigm used by Krauskopf and others in the 1980s. Krauskopf's experiments were aimed at testing theories about how signals from the three cone types were analysed by the brain. One hypothesis is that the post-receptoral circuits in the brain establish two cardinal chromatic mechanisms, an evolutionarily older circuit that compares S versus L+M, and a newer circuit that compares L and M. To test for psychophysical evidence of these mechanisms, Krauskopf measured color detection thresholds before and after participants viewed temporally modulating color fields to adapt the post-receptoral neurons. The adaptation involves a fluctuation between pairs of colours, so the photoreceptors themselves shouldn't be selectively adapted -- you get no chromatic afterimage. But if there is a neural mechanism downstream of the photoreceptors that is selective for the colours used in the adaptation, the participants should show increased detection thresholds selectively for the adaptation colours.

According to the standard model that calls for two cardinal chromatic mechanisms, adaptation colours defined by the L-M axis should cause an increase in detection threshold for L and M coloured spots, but should show no increase in threshold for colours defined by the S axis, illustrated here in the polar plot, where changes in detection threshold for each hue are shown by the length of the radius. Similarly, the standard model says that adaptation to colours defined by the S axis should lead to increases in detection thresholds for just the S colours and not for L and M colours.

### Standard Model

The decisive test of the standard model comes when we use adaptation colours defined by the intermediate axes. These colours will modulate both putative cardinal chromatic mechanisms, knocking them both a bit out of service, so detection thresholds should be elevated for all colours. The prediction is illustrated here, as a circle.

### Human data 

Krauskopf et al originally argued in 1982 that their results supported the cardinal model, but revised their conclusions in 1986 to recognize that adaptation along the intermediate axes brought about increases in color-detection thresholds that were not perfectly in line with the prediction. Instead, adaptation along the intermediate axes brought about a slight increase in detection threshold for colours along the adaptation axis.

### Monkey data

So what did we find in monkeys? Here is the pattern of results we obtained. These results are similar to the results in humans, with some minor differences, which are explored in the papers listed below. For our present purposes, the main take-home of these experiments is that macaque monkeys and humans not only have very similar cone photoreceptors, but also very similar post-receptoral chromatic mechanisms.

### Verbal tests

The lab completed these experiments almost a decade ago, and the natural next question was whether monkeys and humans have similar color categories. That question was a more challenging one to address. The reason is that most assays of color categorization behaviour in humans involve the use of language, and monkeys obviously don't have language. Moreover, the use of language itself has proven problematic in interpreting results in humans because people of different cultural or linguistic backgrounds show some variability in how they categorize colours. The only study that has attempted to measure color category behaviour in monkeys, done in the 1970s, had animals group a set of colours into four pre-defined categories, which is not really the same thing as evaluating how animals spontaneously categorize colours. We've tried a few approaches to tackle this issue over the years, and I think we have finally come up with a paradigm that works. The work is in progress, and I'd welcome feedback. Before we launch into the experiments, it's worth revisiting what we might expect to find given current theories of color categorization.

### Theories of Color Categorization

A simplified cartoon of the current theories of colour categorization might look like this. On one side, are theories that color categories arise because of how we communicate information about colour to each other. These theories include the hard-core Sapir-Whorfian accounts, that color categories depend on language, and by extension, that people with different languages not only categorize colours differently, but see colours differently as a result of their differences in categorization. On the other side, are theories that color categories are the result of some universal feature in how color signals are encoded by the visual system or of regularities in natural scenes. These theories capture the idea that color categories are essentially universal, independent of language, an idea that can be traced to Hering in the early 1900s and his notion that color for all humans can be described by six unique hues (black, white, red, green, blue, and yellow). The modern account of the universalist idea was popularized in the 1960s by Berlin and Kay, who showed that when people are restricted to categorize colours using "basic color terms" they do so pretty consistently across languages.

It has been surprisingly contentious and difficult to sort out how humans categorize colours, often for reasons that are not immediately apparent. For example, many language groups do not have a super-ordinate word "color"---so studies in these cultures require first teaching the people the concept of color, and also teaching them what basic color terms are. It's now clear that this introduces a kind of circularity. Previous work from our lab sought to overcome this circularity. When people are asked to communicate colours and are not restricted to use basic color terms, there is no clear privilege of Berlin and Kay's basic color terms, or Hering's unique hues.

### Game 1

The experiment can be conceived of as a communication game. Let's say you and I have exactly the same array of color chips. I pick one and tell you which it is by using a color name.

### Game 2

How many guesses does it take you to identify the color I picked? If the color name is highly informative, then you won't take many guesses.

### Game 3

We can quantify the communication of color using information theory. This tapestry shows the results for all languages in the World Color Survey, as well as for original data we collected in the Tsimane' (*Chi-mar-niy*) people.

### Tapestry

Each row is data for one language, with languages that are more advanced according to Berlin and Kay's scheme at the top. Within each row, the colours are arranged left to right according to their information scores. Color chips that were labelled with very informative names are on the left. A striking pattern is immediately clear: warm colours are communicated more efficiently than cool colours, and this is true regardless of how fancy the color-naming system is for each language. These results suggest that there is a universal pattern to how colours are categorized, but it is not the scheme advocated by Berlin and Kay.

### Objects

Further work showed that there was a parsimonious logic for this. Objects, the parts of scenes that we are generally most interested in, tend to be warm whereas backgrounds tend to be cool.

Our interest in asking if monkeys categorize colours, and if so, how they do it, is motivated by at least two reasons. First, monkeys do not have language, so how they categorize colours could allow us to isolate linguistic factors. Second, categorization is a hallmark of primate cognition, and independent of the fights color scientists have had about how humans categorize colours, paradigms using color are widely used in research to understand the brain basis for cognition. It would be useful to have an animal model to test hypotheses about the neural implementation of these theories.

### Signatures of categorical behaviour

And so the search was on to find a task where we could look for the signatures of categorisation without requiring a verbal response.

What are these signatures? The two key ones are:

\- Smaller discrimination thresholds across category borders

\- Bias towards best exemplar of category ("focal color") -- whether this be in memorability, salience, looking time etc.

### Bae paradigm

We identified a suitable task by borrowing from the working memory literature. There, studies using color have been extensively used to test working memory capacity and investigate the nature of the errors that can occur in working memory.

In one such experiment, performed by Bae et al. participants were shown a cue color, and then, after a delay, had to estimate that color by selecting a point from a hue circle.

### Bae error

As you might imagine, participants didn't always get this perfectly right. Taking the two colours marked by the triangles as examples, a yellowish color and a blueish color, we would probably expect responses on trials where those colours were shown to cluster around them, with some fall off on either side.

### Bae error 2 (bias)

In the data, what Bae et al. also saw was some biases in the average responses. For the example colours here, the peak of the response distribution for the yellow color is offset by about 10degress of hue angle to the right, and the peak for the blue is offset by about 10degrees to the left.

### Bae distribution

If we look at the distribution of bias as a function of hue, it is clear that there is an underlying structure to these biases.

### Attractor points

In this type of plot, the attractor points (the points where responses are pulled towards) can be found at the centres of the positive slopes, highlighted here by the red circles.

In the other half of this experiment, Bae et al. also collected data on how the stimuli used in that experiment would be categorized, and what the focal colours of certain color categories would be from that stimulus set. These points are indicated here by the black squares. What they found was that the location of the focal colours for orange, green, blue and pink corresponded well with the attractor points -- it seems that people's responses were being biased towards the focal colours for their color categories.

We can't ask monkeys directly how they categorize colours, but we can train them to do a memory recall task, and see whether they have systematic biases, and then use the relationship between these biases and color categories to infer whether they have color categories, and if so, what they are.

### Modified paradigm

We modified the paradigm such that instead of estimating from a continuous scale our monkeys would be presented with an alternative forced choice where there were 4 choices on each trial -- one direct match, and three random distractors sampled from the same set as the cues.

The reasons we did this were two-fold. Firstly, it makes our paradigm more flexible because we're not locked into a single spatially defined response space -- we can distort the sampling or sample across other dimensions without any fundamental changes to the paradigm. Secondly, when you're doing psychophysics with humans there's a certain amount of intrinsic motivation that you can rely on -- if you ask a participant to do something, especially if you tell them that it will be rewarded, with money, they'll try and do it. When you're doing psychophyics with monkeys the only way to communicate the task, is with selective reward on every trial, and the cleanest way to do that is to have clear and well-defined correct and incorrect response options. Without these, you run a real risk of monkeys developing biases based on what they *think* you want them to do, rather than actually what you want them to do. This is why a free selection is not effective when working with monkeys. 4AFC provides a way for us to have clear right and wrong answers.

### Monkey data intro

By looking just at the trials on which the monkey got it wrong, we can perform a similar analysis to that of Bae et al, and quantify the biases across color space.

To zoom out for a second: under the hypothesis that the primary importance of color categories is the communication of color information from one person to another, we would expect there to be a shared and stable set of color categories. In the absence of language, this requirement is relaxed - if color categories are useful mechanisms but unconnected to biology or scene statistics, then we might expect them to be entirely idiosyncratic, whereas if they are grounded in biology and/or scene statistics then we might still expect them to be shared across observers.

### Monkey data reveal

What we see in our monkey data is that there are systematic biases, and the structure differs to that collected in humans.

### Bootstrap

Through bootstrapping we can estimate our confidence about the location of the monkey's categories, given the data we have. Plotted here is the mean attractor point, and our 95% confidence intervals, for monkey 1. We have a lot of data from monkey one, and as such we can see that we have quite high confidence in the locations of his color categories.

We see two clear categories, which appear to align with our concepts of \'warm\' and \'cool\' (an orangey color and a blueish color).

### All monkeys

So far we\'ve collected data in additional animals, and it is interesting to consider commonalities and differences that we see between the animals. All three share these warm and cool categories. In monkey 3 we identify two additional categories.

### Strength

In addition to looking at the location of the categories, we can consider the relative \"strength\" of the categories - the extent to which an category biases memories towards it. These values are the gradient of the bias at the category centre, and so are on a scale of 0 to 90. From this we can see that the green category in monkey 3 is a strong category, in line with the others identified, but that the purple category is barely present.

### Power

We can also look at the number of trials we would have needed to reach our current conclusions, to allay concerns that we might be missing other categories by not having collected enough data. We can see that our analysis pulls out the same categories with considerably less data than the total collected.

### Learning rates

We can also look at the relative learning rates for each color -- the speed with which each animal got proficient at trials for different hues. We find that there is structure in these learning rates, and our current theory is that this structure is a function of the post-receptoral contrast for each stimulus, but analysis here is ongoing.

### 

### Multi-sat

I mentioned earlier that we chose to use an AFC version of this task instead of an estimation from a continuous response space. This allows us to very easily adapt the experiment to consider other dimensions of interest. We\'ve recently been running a modified version of the experiment where we also include variation in saturation, and the results of this have been informative in a couple of ways.

First, I should say that one of the key differences between macaques and humans seems to be that humans are significantly better at generalisation. For example, in training the animals on tasks like this we start simple, and then slowly build up the task complexity. Often, when we change something that we would consider to be fairly trivial to task comprehension, such as changing the number of presented choices from 3 to 4, often the monkeys would act as though we'd presented them with a completely new task.

I'm going to show you a heatmap of the cues against the choices. So if the cue was this blue, and the chosen choice was this green, this element of the grid would be increased by 1 count at this location.

If the animal performed perfectly, we would see a filled in diagonal.

### Filled heatmap

And that is what you do see. They did not seem to conceive of this as a fundamentally different task.

We were also curious to see whether the animals would have a bias for higher saturation targets, as some believe humans would.

If the animal always picked the more saturated version of the color, then in an extreme case we would expect to see the lower half of the diagonal to be offset to the other quadrant. Inversely, if they always picked the less-saturated version then we would expect to see the top half offset.

What we actually see is a slight bias for higher saturations, but actually a relatively balanced distribution of errors between higher saturation and lower saturation. This provides some confidence that saturation isn\'t a major issue for the key findings, and also reinforces this second finding that the monkeys consider saturation and hue to be part of the same framework.

To summarise this:

1\. They can generalise the task

2\. saturation is unlikely to be the driving force behind the categories

3\. the monkeys do not appear to show a bias between high and low saturation, which is curious because it\'s often said that humans have a preference for high saturation colours

### fMRI

What we\'ve shown is that the psychophysical results in monkeys and humans are comparable at the photoreceptor, post-receptoral, and at the stage of color categories. It looks as though their color categories differ from ours, but the evidence suggests that they do have color categories.

Our fMRI results have discovered a large extensive network of brain regions implicated in processing of color in both humans and monkeys. The functional organisation of these networks is comparable, and we now, by virtue of the similarity of the psychophysical behaviour between monkeys and humans can be assured that the neural mechanisms that we uncover through invasive experiments in monkeys will pertain to the human case.

### In conclusion:

-   There are two color categories that are common to all 3 monkeys

-   These color categories correspond to the human distinction of warm and cool

-   The underlying template for the fundamental structure of color categories for trichromatic primates appears universal, potentially determined by the color statistics of relevant parts of scenes (objects)

### Notes

\- Do new categories split or amend?

\- Limitations of iso-saturated stimuli - no good reds or yellows (Mubaraka Muchhala figure?)

\- more on methods? (colorspace and sampling)

\- Buster head-free?

questions that people will ask:

\- why not use a disk?

\- are the results just an artefact from using the wrong colorspace? (Panichello+ 2019 SF5)

\- to what extent do these categories align with:

\- the daylight/plankian locus

\- cone opponent dimensions

Mention that this is training towards another task? (otherwise does it seem indulgent to use these animals for this alone?)
