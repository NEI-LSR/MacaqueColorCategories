10:52:46 From   Michael Semenov  to  Everyone:
	For some reason, I don't see Jasna Martinovic's screen.
10:53:02 From  Adam Reeves  to  Everyone:
	I wonder if lightness wander more in visual memory than does hue, over the 5 sec delay.
10:54:05 From  Adam Reeves  to  Everyone:
	I wonder if 5 secs is too long to hold a lightness value in mind, as compared to a hue.
10:55:57 From  Bevil Conway  to  Everyone:
	Very interesting talk Jasna. I'm wondering if you can speculate about the potential causal role that neural encoding mechanisms of color and luminance might play in the extent to which we can learn these labels?
10:57:41 From  Christoph Witzel  to  Everyone:
	Cool, Jasna. I wonder whether you can assume that discriminability does not affect learning success. Also, I agree with the idea of category effects on memory (with delay) is more robust than effects on (simultaneous) perception.
10:59:16 From  Galina Paramei  to  Everyone:
	Could the lightness difference pay a greater role in protan learners?
11:20:44 From  jdavi  to  Everyone:
	you should look at the work of Fagot and Davidoff for the lack of colour categories in macaques
11:25:01 From  Eli Brenner  to  Everyone:
	Another approach can be found in Sandell JH, Gross CG, Bornstein MH. Color categories in macaques. J Comp Physiol Psychol. 1979 93(4):626-35.
11:25:29 From  David Brainard (he/him/his)  to  Everyone:
	Have you tried humans in your exact task/stimuli?
11:26:15 From  Christoph Witzel  to  Everyone:
	I got the impression that the two warm and cold categories coincide with the minima in hue discrimination in humans.
11:26:37 From  Jenny Bosten  to  Everyone:
	Hi Danny, thanks for the talk! Just wondered (sorry if I missed it), whether your polar plots on macaque hue categories are based on a macaque version of the MacLeod-Boynton diagram? Looked like where there were 4 categories they were close to the cardinal axes.
11:27:13 From  Ian Pennock  to  Danny Garside (he/him)(Direct Message):
	Great talk :)
11:27:15 From  Lindsay MacDonald  to  Danny Garside (he/him)(Direct Message):
	Well done Danny. It's great to see you doing such excellent research. Best wishes.
11:29:45 From  Anna Franklin  to  Danny Garside (he/him)(Direct Message):
	Great talk Danny. I love your use of the hue memory bias to track categories in your monkeys - clever idea.  Very interesting the warm cool categories that you get out too given the importance of that distinction for objects and environments.
11:30:32 From  Bevil Conway  to  Danny Garside (he/him)(Direct Message):
	and to David Brainard's point: we do in fact think that humans would look like monkeys, given the object-color statistics and communication results
11:30:48 From  David Brainard (he/him/his)  to  Everyone:
	On Christophâ€™s point, I htink that  if discrimination thresholds are changing around the hue circle, that can in principle produce biases, with more errors in the direction of higher thresholds.  That is, I think an asymmetry of threshold along a stimulus dimension can in turn lead to a bias in errors.
11:31:10 From  Adam Reeves  to  Everyone:
	did monkey 3 pay more attention to the red/green difference in, say, experimenter's clothes ?
11:31:27 From  Kowa Koida  to  Everyone:
	Very impressive talk. The matching task between two different saturation levels was quite interesting. Did you see some tendency similar to the Abney effect?
11:32:05 From  Christoph Witzel  to  Everyone:
	I think in CIELUV it may even explain all four categories, with the two being most prominent
11:38:02 From  Alice Skelton  to  Danny Garside (he/him)(Direct Message):
	great talk Danny! really interesting. Impressive you manage to get passive categories from monkeys
