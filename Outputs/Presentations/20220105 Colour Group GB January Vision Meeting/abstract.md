How does the brain make color vision happen? Knowledge of the circuit-level neuronal mechanisms depends on invasive experiments in animal models such as macaque monkeys. But do monkeys and humans have the same color vision? Psychophysical tests have been used in humans and monkeys to make inferences about the neural mechanisms that underlie color processing from photoreceptors through the visual-processing hierarchy: trichromacy, opponency, and post-receptoral chromatic mechanisms. I will review this work, and discuss our on-going approaches to determine color categories in monkeys.
