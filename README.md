# MacaqueColorCategories

This repo is the home for the Macaque Color Categories project.

## Code requirements

There are various submodules on this project.
To fill them, either clone the repo with `git clone --recurse-submodules -j8 git://github.com/foo/bar.git` or clone the repo normally and then run:
```
git submodule init
git submodule update
```

This project also requires PsychToolbox (though not super heavily, mainly just LuvToXYZ to plotting, I think...)
